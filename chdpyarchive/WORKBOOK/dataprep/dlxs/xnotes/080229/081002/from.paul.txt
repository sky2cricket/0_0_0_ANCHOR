Ok, it is done.

 in /root/temp

are the files:

dlxs20081002-save.sql    which is the one I just did with the good 00 and 01 records.

dlxs_20080801T040101.sql   which is the aug 1st edition  we have restored this morning.

In case you need to, you can put the whole db back with

mysql -uyouruser -p dlxs < dlxs20081002-save.sql

(I'm not sure if that will worK with the aug 1st edition, you may have to delete the dlxs db to do that one.  The other one I made with drop-table commands so it will replace tables as it goes.)
