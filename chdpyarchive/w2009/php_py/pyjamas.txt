17th August 2009 The MSHTML Pyjamas-Desktop port takes shape! Various interesting technical challenges have been mostly overcome, to bring IE's engine to the mix. This is not the same approach as, for example, Titanium, which enables <script type="text/python" />. The MSHTML port of Pyjamas Desktop actually embeds an IWebBrowser2 Active-X instance into a Win32 window, provides access to the Document of the IWebBrowser2 using Python/COM, and goes from there. In other words, other than the python "comtypes" package, which is only 140k, and IE itself, there are no additional dependencies required to get pyjamas applications running under MSHTML. 
6th July 2009 Pyjamas compiles the Python version of PureMVC. Kees Bos improved the pyjamas compiler to the point where PureMVC would compile to Javascript and run with zero modifications. He has also ported the Employee Admin wxWidgets example to run under Pyjamas, and it is close to working under PyJD as well. 
2nd July 2009 Pyjamas Desktop is ported to run under XUL, the Browser engine behind Mozilla Firefox. Thanks to Hulahop (from the OLPC Sugar team) and to the developers of python-xpcom, Pyjamas Desktop was successfully ported to XUL in only two days.
