howto_CRLF.txt


The tei file seems to contain microsoft CRLF characters to separate lines.

In vi these appear as double-spaces.

But when you download to notepad on my windows machine, it comes out as one long line
in both notepad and word pad.

If you open with MS Word, the CRLF line separators are correct,
but the <xxx>...</xxx> is over interpreted.

I think vi is interpreting CRLF as \n\n and ^@ things.

This is a continuation of the war between microsoft and berkeley unix.

================================================================

How to get rid of double spacing in vi on the unix server:


:%s />\n/>/


How this works:

There is a \n\n after each > character.
But this makes the second \n go on the next line.

If you require > in the replacement string, only the first \n gets replaced.

The replacement below also works.

:%s />\n/>/g


The replacement

:%s /\n\n/\n/ gives you one long line in vi with linebreaks ^@ between what used to be line breaks.

The ^@ is the CR in the CRLF separator.

So the actual replacement is

:%s /CRLFCRLF/LF/  which leaves the second ^@ as debris.
