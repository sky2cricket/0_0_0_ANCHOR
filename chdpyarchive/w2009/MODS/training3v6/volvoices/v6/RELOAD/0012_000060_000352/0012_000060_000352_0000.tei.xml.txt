				<p>My dear Sister,</p>
				<p>I wrote a letter some time ago to you, but missed the oppotunity of sending it, I will send it along now. There
				was an opportunity of writing by Esquire Harris, but we were over the river on visit to our relations, about that time
				and missed it also - It is a long time since I have received a word or a line from you, My dear Sister would it be
				to much, to expect to see you here this winter we all earnestly desire it and I think sincerely you aught to come
				for your own sake, and the sake of your family. What is property, convenience, or life itself without health and
				happiness, Brother Billy wants very much to go and see you</p>

				<p>and would go if he could get a man to take the charge of the farm, but he has been trying and cannot get
				any - Dady has had publick business to do that has confined him at home all summer and is oblidged to be at Salisbury
				Court this month - I hope you will not wait to see any of your relations, but fix up and start immediately, before
				the cold weather sets in, and stay all winter with us and I hope you will return home in the Spring healthy and
				vigorous as you used to be, both in body and mind, and then I am sure you will do more good for yourself, your
				family, and the world in one year than you can do at present in half a dozzen - Do pray my dear Brother and</p>

				<p>Sister think seriously of these things and do what appears to be your duty - Mr. Wallis was taken sick about
				two weeks ago down at Providence he is removed up to his fathers sister and the children are there now the last
				account Mr. Wallis was getting better - It is very healthy at present in this neighbourhood though in some
				parts of this country it is very sickly - Mr. Caldwell is at a singing school this day I suppose he will write this
				nights to you - I will conclude with repeating my desire that you would seriously think of spending the winter
				in this country I remain your affectionate</p>
				<p>Sister</p>
				<p>Abigail B. Caldwell</p>
