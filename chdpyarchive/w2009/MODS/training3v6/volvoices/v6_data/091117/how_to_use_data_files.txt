how_to_use_data_files.txt

1.  Data Files were created by:

	http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/~cdeane/w2009/MODS/training3v6/training3v6_GET.php?
	admindb_data=0037_000052_000200&adb_fullname=Cricket_w2009&test=test_w2009

	This is a semi-preloaded workbook (bypass admin db) that is filled in using
	the forms on page_begin, page_1, page_2, etc.

2.  Cut and paste the data file into the Reload Page 

	http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/~cdeane/w2009/MODS/training3v6/volvoices/v6/page_reload.htm

	and then click the button "Process Data in Text Area"

	This puts the data into page_upper, then when you click on the page link,
	the form for that page will be filled out.

3.  Naming of the data files:

	page_01_data_001.txt refers to an xml file created using page_01.
	The 001.txt denotes the first version.

	All version of page_01 data will be named with the prefix page_01_data_

	If a data file contains multiple page output, it should be named for
	the highest page number.

	For example, a data file created using page_01 and page_02 should be named

	page_02_data_00N.txt

4.      Violation of naming conventions will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
