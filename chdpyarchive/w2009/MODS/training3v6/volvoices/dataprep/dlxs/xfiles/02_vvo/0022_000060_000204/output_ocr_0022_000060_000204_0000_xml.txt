Aug. 31st, 1918. rite: .., Your letter of the 26th instant received and noted. I never hated to vote for a measure more in my life than I did to send the eighteen year old boys. We were assured, however, that the eighteen year old boys would not be sent for for a year and that it was absolutely necessary to have the men. I believe that if we furnish all the men that are needed now without stint we will soon have this war won. These views led me to violate all my preconceived notions and vote as I did. about it. very sincerely yours, Mr. C. P. Simonton, County Court Clerk, Covington, Tennessee. </p> </div1> </body> </text></DLPSTEXTCLASS>
