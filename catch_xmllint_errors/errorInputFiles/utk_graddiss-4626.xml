The temperature range of measurements varied with different specimens but in general were between 375 K to 1300 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pulse calorimeter essentially consists of a specimen in series with a standard resistor and a programmable power supply. The specimen is inside a vacuum chamber. The programmable power supply can be triggered from t
