Recently developed methods based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) allow for the simultaneous identification and definition of well concerved motifs and gene families using very large whole genome datasets. In contrast, this work discusses the use of a truncated pivoted QR factorization as a scalable alternative to the SVD for comparing whole genomes in a phylogenetic context. This algorithm computes the
