HEARTBREAK IN ROCHESTER (and Subsequent Repair)
>   A Short Story by Orion Knox
>
> This adventure is based on true events and features real characters.
>
> Fly to Rochester, MI on Monday the 5th of May. You know its not just another
> sleepy little farm town when you land at the airport, which is in a corn
> field, and see private jets lined up on the parking ramps. This is a great
> town of about 75,000, 20 percent who work at the Mayo Clinic.
>
> Check into Mayo for initial evaluation on the 6th. This is quite an
> international place as there were patients speaking many foreign languages,
> some of which we had no idea where they came from. There is even an office
> for translators on the first floor of the Mayo Building. The Mayo Clinic
> complex is made up of several (8-10)large buildings in down-town Rochester.
> In addition there are two huge hospitals within walking distance.
>
> My admitting cardiologist, Dr. Mock, who coordinated a full day of testing
> on my first day there and the angiogram on the second day, said I had the> worst regurgitation (leak) in a  mitral valve he had ever seen. He said
> it was so loud it should have kept me awake at night. On a scale of 1-6
> with 6 being the worst, mine rated a very strong 5. On the positive side,> the angiogram showed I had "prestine" coronary arteries. Maybe the valve
> was so bad it couldn't get the crud to the arteries. Maybe all that
> Lockhart BBQ actually had healing powers. By the way, I chose not to be
> sedated durng the angiogram so that I could see what was going on. It
> was interesting.
>
> Anyway, on day three, I was wheeled into a large operating theater where
> Dr. Francisco Puga introduced himself to me and thats about the last
> I remember for the next three days. Dr Puga did the surgery without event> (as open-heart surgery goes), placing an anuloplasty band or ring (imagine
> a tiny Slinky wrapped in cloth) around the valve and tying the loose
> fiberous tissue that is supposed to keep the valve leaflets in place, to
> the ring. In technical terms he did a "repair of mitral valve and
> insertion of a 30 mm Cosgrove-Edwards annuloplasty band, valvuloplasty,
> and transesophageal echocardiogram".
>
> I was then moved to the intensive care unit where I stayed for two days.
> I don't have much recollection of this but Jan related some interesting
> stories.
>
> There were two nurses with me at all times monitoring my condition. She
> said one had a shop vac and went around sucking up all the blood that was> leaking out from the various holes and tubes in my chest, and she said there
> were many, forced it through a Fram oil filter (nothing but the best),
> thinned it down with a little tap water and pumped it back into me. I think
> it may have been a little more sophisticated than this but you get the gist.
> As a result, no outside blood was used.
>
> When Jan asked about the two sets of jumper cables coming out of my chest> the nurse told her she had already figured it out. If for any reason the
> heart stopped, they would be able to get me jump started without having to
> re-enter the chest. This I didn't mind until they later pulled them out.
> The battery clamps on the ends hurt like hell as they came through.
>
> Days five and six were not very eventful except that I was on intervenous> feeding and my heart was in and out of atrial fibrillation. Various drugs> and doses were being used to try to convert it to sinus (good) rhythem.
> Drugs resulted in some !really! wierd dreams. Ask me about them sometime,> they're to complex for this short story.
>
> Days seven through about nine were real bummers. They tried to wean me off
> the I.V. and onto solid food. Have you ever tried to heave up an entire meal
> less than a week after having your breast bone sawn down the middle. It isn't
> any fun, beleeeave me! Any way, now we have two problems, atrail fibrilation
> and very unhappy stomach. More experimentation with various drugs and
> consultation with other specialist. Dreams continue.
>
> Day ten, stomach fixed or at least calmed down enough to eat. Fibrillation
> continues. The decision was made that I would be D/C (yes, as in electricity)
> cardioverted. They put me on an electically insulated mattress in this small
> room with a window looking in, put a very cold paddle of stainless steel
> under my right shoulder, pulled the curtain closed, put another cold SS
> paddle on top of my left chest and gave me a 200 volt wakeup call.
> Fortunately, they had put me to sleep after the paddle went under the right
> shoulder. Woke up with an oxygen mask over my face and a little sorer than
> when I had gone in. Sinus rhythem achieved, YEA!!! Stayed in recovery for> 30 or so minutes then back to Jan in my room. REAL BUMMER!!, in about 2 1/2
> hours it reconverted to atrail fibrillation. More head scratching and new> drug. Master Electrician to be called in next morning. Went to sleep still
> in fibrillation. (Sleep is a relative term, every night they would come in
> 2-3 times to take my temperature and blood pressure, give me a pill at
> midnight and draw blood between 2:00 and 4:00 AM.
>
> Well sometime about 2:30 AM, my heart, threatened with more and higher D/C,
> decided that it wasn't any fun any more and converted over to sinus rhythm
> on its own. PHEW!!! Dreams subsiding, or at least now my brain
> doesn't take them very seriously.
>
> Day 11, Heart continues to behave and appetite gets much better. Beginning
> to get stir crazy as health returns. Had numerous counciling sessons on
> post discharge dos and don'ts. They have a way of getting your attention on
> some of them, RE: not picking up to much weight (5-10 lb. limit for six
> weeks); story related of a man this past winter who checked out and went
> home. The next day he hired someone to shovel snow from his walk. He was not
> satisfied with progress so he took the shovel and started to do it himself.
> Result, back on the operating table getting his sternum rewired. RE: being
> sure to take my blood thinner; "at my age I didn't want to wake up in a
> nursing home, lying on my side with drool oozing out the corner of my mouth.
> That certainly made an impression on the old cortex.
>
> Day 12, DISCHARGED/FREEDOM AT LAST!!!! and fly back to Austin the next day,
> May 18.
>
> Final stats:
>
> Entered with burnt valve and only running on about three cylindars.
> Left with new valve job and hitting on all four.
>
> Entered at 64.5 kg (142.2 lbs.)
> Left at 58.4 kg (128.7 lbs.) and I didn't have that much to loose.
>
> Most pain; when I sneezed about the third day after the operation.
>
> Favorite food; a steak....after I checked out.
>
> Favorite nurse; all were exceptional, helpful, encouraging and just plain> great! I did have a Laotion girl who came in every morning between two and
> four and drew blood samples that always had something happy to say, which> was nice when I was most often lying there awake anyway.
>
> Funniest get well card; from Rune and Susan. Image; four 'Far Side'
> surgeons hovered over the patient's chest when some unidentifiable body
> part comes flying "BOING" out. Caption; "Whoa! Watch where that thing
> lands - we'll probably need it."
>
> Favorite pass time for Jan and her folks who had many boring hours when
> they couldn't be with me or I just wanted to rest; a 1,500 piece jigsaw
> puzzle of the Matterhorn in one of the visitor lounges.
> Outcome; almost completed.
>
> Summary:
> I'm doing much better now (May 20) With Jan and two cats looking after
> me, what more could I ask for, other than a little less ache in the
> sternum and where the left rib cage was pried out from the spine.
>
> All went well with the operation on the mitral valve. Dr. Puga, one of
> the Mayo's best cardiac surgeons, did the work and was able to salvage
> my valve rather than put in an artificial valve. This was very
> important to me as the artificial valve would have meant my taking
> Coumadin (a blood thinner) for the rest of my life.
>
> Irony; everyone knows how much I love Mexico. Both my surgeon,
> Dr. Francisco Puga and my resident physician, Dr. Octavio Herrera who
> looked after my day to day needs, are from Mexico City.
>
> Thanks to everyone for their support, especially Jan, and her parents
> who gave us both support.
