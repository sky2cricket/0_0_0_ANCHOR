You're right.  We just returned from a week of interviews, and the opening
of the first phase of the cavern -- the Rotunda and Throne room tour, as
well as the visitors center at the park.  The first day was a media blitz
with 5 television networks, newspapers and radio.  Orion was interviewed by
the Christian Science Monitor, and several Spanish language newspapers
(since he can speak it).  This day was the VIP cave tours for about 500
invited guests including the current and past governors of AZ, legislators
involved in passing the bill to buy 'the secret cave' for the state, the
Kartchner family (landowners), the cave consultants and developers (this was
our group), Randy Tufts and Gary Tenen (discovers)and local officials who
helped get funding for the project, and the many volunteers who helped
during the past 14 years in helping keep the cave secret until it was
purchased by the state of Arizona, and helped in development of the state
park.  After the cave tours, a special program was held at the amphitheater
included 1. an Apache blessing ceremony, 2. Navajo flute music by Sarah
Roundtree,3. several musical pieces by Aaron Coupland played by the Tucson
Symphony, 4. the Tucson Boys Choir sang  songs from the Sons of the
Pioneers, 5. dancing from the Tucson division of Ballet Folklorico, 6.
closing out the special program was a piece composed by the Tucson Symphony
for the cavern opening "One Drop at a Time".  This was followed by a catered
dinner for the horde (wine and beer or soft drinks , then tapas, beef
tenderloin, pork tenderloin, salmon, grilled vegetables, tossed salad and
cheesecake or torte for dessert.  Much more food than one could possibly eat
so just tried a little taste of it all.  Several huge Circus tents housed
all of these happenings.  The next three days were for city, community and
county officials and families to tour the cave, visit the 'discovery center'
(visitors center), see the park facilities, and have a catered barbque
lunch.  About 500-700 each day were hosted.  The last day hosted all the
people who worked on the cave development, and vendors to supplied materials
to the park during this work. It was about 750 this last day.  We have been
wined and dined for a week, what a media event!!!
Did you happen to see the NBC evening news with Tom Brokoff on Nov. 5th?
They aired a special on the opening, we were there during this broadcast.
Mailed you a postcard from the park, soon be arriving soon.
  More later, have to finish unpacking as just flew in late last night.

Dear Jan,
I am alive and well and far too
busy here in Tennessee.  Working
for a company called ISSI.  Helped
write a significant portion of our
tutorial/reference site at:

http://www.devguru.com

Spotted this on the web this morning

http://www.msnbc.com/news/331869.asp

about Kartchner.  As I recall you all
helped map the cave.  Strange, but I
thought there were no caves in Arizona!
Bill
