Haven't hear from the student recently...assume all is going well, just
that you are very busy.  

We also have been busy since the first of the year, lots of computer
jobs, and I am now in two galleries here in Texas.  Being forced (ha ha)
to go out to Santa Fe for a meeting end of the month...may visit with
some galleries if I can get together a photo album.

Hope the family is doing well, we send greetings to all.
