Val, Jim, et al--

As I wrote before we will be having a TSA Project to clean up, remove
graffiti, and restore Gruta del Palmito at Bustamante, NL over the Labor Day
weekend.  This is a large cave needing a lot of work.  We will be able to
make only a small dent in the damage over this 3 or 4 day weekend, even with
a hundred cavers. 

A triumvirate of honchos has been formed of able and honorable caver in thepersons of Orion Knox, Runi Burnett, and Charlie Loving, with Terry Plemons,
me, and others doing whatever we can.   

Clean up is probably the easiest part, requiring only picking up
trash--mostly cans, batteries, etc--putting them in plastic bags, and toting
them out of the cave.  We've done it several times in years past and it waseasy enough.  Formation restoration will consist mostly of planning what todo first.  

What we don't have is personnel, equipment, or experience for graffiti
removal.  The lowest common denominator throughout the cave is graffiti.
Damn near every wall, every rock, every formation, every everything has been
tagged at some time in the past 90 years.  We need A LOT OF EXPERTISE, a lot
of equipment, and a lot of help.  This is not a trivial undertaking.  We
will need to obtain our own equipment and crews in he future.  It will takeseveral years to complete the mass removal of all the graffiti we can.  We
have the complete cooperation of the local officials in charge of the cave
and will get some help from the local folks.  And we have cavers willing tohoncho the project.  

But what we need now is the expertise to get this thing started in a big
way.  We are asking all cavers who have any knowlege and experience at
graffiti removal to consider dropping whatever their other plans are &
converge on Bustamante for this project.  We are asking you to contact any
caver who is not addressed above who may have such expertise and equipment
and implore them to attend.  We are asking for names and addresses (e-mail
is best) of anyone who should be contacted, including the above, who would
be useful.  We also are asking for some of you to produce a list of brushes,
bottles, chemicals, etc that the average caver can arm themselves with
before showing up at Bustamante.  But we will need experienced graffiti
removers to show them how to proceed without further damaging the cave.  Ifwe can make a good showing this time we can give this Project the boost--the
kick in the butt--that it will need to get it on the way to success.  We are
asking that you give every consideration and as much energy and enthusiam to
attend the TSA Clean-up/Restoration Project at Bustamante over this coming
Labor Day weekend, starting 28 or 29 August and lasting through Monday the
1st of September.  

All Grottos are asked to start pumping up their members to attend.  This isa major project.  We will thank you all for doing what you can.  If you need
any clarification or more info please contact me.

Watch the next few TSA Activities Newsletters for details, maps, schedules,etc. 
Thanks,

--Gill Ediger
