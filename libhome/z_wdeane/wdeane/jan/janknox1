Back in school ...what a surprise.  I am now semi-retired, have quit 
working for the state of Texas, just computer consultant and artist now. 
Currently working on two contracts for software that will be offering 
for sale on the Internet soon.

This labor day weekend (Sept.'97) we are hosting cavers from several 
states (TX, NM, WV,OK) doing a cave cleanup, graffeti removal, and 
improving the entrance room trail at Bustamante, Grutas de Palmito.
That is starting on Saturday, then on Sunday will continue with work in 
the entrance room and also rig several nearby pit caves for exploration, 
MonteMajor at Minas Viaja, and Precipico in the canyon.  Sunday evening 
will be a big feed and party at the campground outside of town near the 
Ojos de Agua.  We will be getting all the logistics taken care of this 
summer.  We expect from 100 to 200 cavers at the event.

Take care and study hard!!!
