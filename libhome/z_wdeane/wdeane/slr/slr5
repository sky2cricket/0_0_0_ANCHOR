Dear Susan,
 
When I saw this book, thoughts of you drifted into my mind.

I first knew of Tina Modotti because she was the mistress of the famous
photographer, Edward Weston, when he lived in Mexico during the 1920's.
Considering the time period, this was rather scandulous behavior!  Yet, 
Tina Modotti was a very accomplished photographer in her own right.  She
had that rare ability to perceive a picture as art and produced several
exceptional images.  In 1991, one of her black and white prints, entitled
"roses", sold for $190,000 which, at the time, set a record for a single
photograph.  Had she continued in photography, I feel certain that she 
would have become a major figure in the medium.

Yet, perhaps like you, her true great passion was not photography...
