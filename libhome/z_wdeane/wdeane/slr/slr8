Dear Susan,

Cleaned house last night and I was about to toss these.
Then my brain turned on.  Will send more recent issues
in a few days.  Outside is a very interesting magazine.

Glad you enjoyed the book about Tina.  It is a shame she
did not stay in photography.  I feel certain that she
would have matured into one of the great photographers
of our century.  I see no sinister forces in her death.
Medicine is only now realizing how common heart disease
and problems are for women.
