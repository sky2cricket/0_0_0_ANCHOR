Susan,

Well, I just picked up an "empty" envelope and found my letter from
September and the magazines in it.  Please forgive me, I am normally not 
so brain dead!  I wondered why I had not heard from you...

I promise to send a new selection of magazine soon.  I just decided to
send them in order by date.

It would be an understatement to say I have been very busy.  Far too
busy.  My last final is December 14th and graduation is the 20th.  So
the end is in sight.

Please let me know how you are doing.
