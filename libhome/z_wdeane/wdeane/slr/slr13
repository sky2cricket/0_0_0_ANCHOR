Dear Susan,

No, I have not forgotten about you!!

This summer has been something else.  I am very glad that it is over.
The worst part was I did not get to the beach.  And so you did not receive
any beach postcards.  The reason I did not go to the beach was that I had 
major surgery.  The doctor warned me that it would take most of summer to 
recouperate.  Of course, he was right, but I was far too stubborn to 
really believe him.  It was really amazing to have to take a nap 
everyday...  

Meanwhile, I had to continue working on my thesis project, plus take a 
course.  I had hoped to have the thesis project done just as the fall
semester started.  Nope!  I finished the text yesterday (Thursday, 9/10)
and presented my defense today.  So that is a major hurtle behind me.
Tonight, I'll barbeque steaks and break open a bottle of wine from the
island of Madeira.  I very very rarely drink, but I recently saw a 
TV show that discussed the Island of Madeira and mentioned the wine
for which the island is famous.  So, I searched all over Knoxville and
found a bottle.  Madeira is an island of volcanic origin in the Atlantic 
Ocean which was the first colony established by a power in Europe, 
Portugal around 1427 AD.

I am taking two courses this fall and should graduate this December.

In early summer, I mailed you a large box of magazines via 4th class
mail.  (Slow boat to China type book rate)   Well, guess what, it was
returned to me the same way.  By then, I had had the surgery and I simply
did not have the time or strength to deal with it. 

So here are some magazines.

How are you doing???  How goes your appeal for parole???
Specifically, how are things inside your head?????

Your friend,






Bill
