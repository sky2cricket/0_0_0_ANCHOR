Dear Ms. Rosenberg:

While surfing the net, I came across your poem, 
"Shadow Life."  I found it to be challenging, 
thoughtful, and provocative.  Inspite of the fact 
that we are poles apart politically, I would 
urge you to to have more of your poetry published.  
Good social and political poems are becoming very 
rare.  Which is too bad.

How are you doing?  Physically?  Mentally?  Is 
there anything I can do for you?  Can I send you 
anything?
