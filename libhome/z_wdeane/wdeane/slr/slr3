Dear Ms. Rosenberg,

I regret to inform you that the 20" by 30" photograph that I sent you
has been returned to me with a "UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL" sticker.  I guess
this is of no surprize to you...

I wish to very sincerely apologize for having offered you something that 
I am prohibited from giving you.  I promise to be far more sensitive to
such matters in the future.

You asked for more postcards and I have enclosed one of my favorites.
It was taken on Waterrock Knob on the Blue Ridge Parkway looking west
towards the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  It had rained most of
day, yet, I had taken several good photographs between showers.  As I
was driving home, I suddenly realized that it was clearing up.  So I
stopped at Waterrock Knob, set up my 4"x5" camera, and waited.  The sun
only came out for a few minutes.  There was no one else on the mountain.
I was the only one who saw this sunset.

Sincerely yours,




Bill Deane
