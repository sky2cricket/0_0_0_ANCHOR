Dear Employment Services
<p />
I would like to apply for the Senior IT Technologist II position in the College of Human Ecology 
which was advertised in the Knoxville News-Sentinel. 
<p />
I earned my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee in 1998.  
I have a strong background in science and technology, and I have worked with computers all of my life.
<p />
I helped develop the DevGuru Web Site, 
which is one of the most successful reference sources ever created for the Internet.
The purpose of DevGuru is to provide the Web Designer with comprehensive information about 
the computer languages and programming techniques used to create web sites on the Internet.
I created all, or the major portions, of the extensive Quick References for the following computer languages: 
 ADO, ASP, CSS2, HTML, Jet SQL, VBScript, WML, WMLScript, XHTML, and XSLT. 
These are the languages that serve as the backbone of the Internet.
For each language, the Quick Reference explains the syntax and grammar (properties. methods, functions, constants, 
objects, events, statements, operators, etc.) and provides useful, working examples 
(which I created and tested).
I also created the T-SQL Syntax charts, plus numerous feature articles 
that explain how to actually program important, useful tasks such as client-side form verification 
and how to create style using selectors. 
<p/>
The DevGuru site currently enjoys well over 170 million hits and well over 36 million page views per year.
You find that I am one of a very few number of people in this part of the country that have worked on a, "mega-site."
I urge you to tour the DevGuru site at: http://www.devguru.com
This will give you a clear understanding of my background in web development. 
<p />
I also have a long and successful history of creating training manuals that are both 
comprehensible and user friendly.
Further, I enjoy interacting with people and I pride myself on my positive, patient demeanor. 
<p />
You have much to gain by adding me to your staff.
<p />
Sincerely yours,
<p />&nbsp;
<p />
Bill Deane
