	Mr. Deane,
	Hoping this finds you at the same e-mail address. OBER had reached an
agreement on two photographs that LAMAR had used for creative. We are
interested in photographs with black bear cubs, possibly with or without an
adult bear. Would you have any of this nature we could review for usage?
	Additionally, could we secure the slide of the two photographs agreed upon?
We would use them just to produce an 8x10, which allows a sharper image to
reproduce on the billboards. The slides would be immediately returned to
you. We are in the pre-production stage of this, so any immediate assistance
you could give us would be deeply appreciated.
	You can contact me here at LAMAR Advertising at 293-0121 or on my mobile at
789-6118.
		Thank You---Charlie Brown
