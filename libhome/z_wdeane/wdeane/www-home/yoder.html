<p />
Dear Mr. Yoder,
<p />
I would like to apply for the Information Systems Administrator position that you have advertised in The Knoxville News-Sentinel.  
I have enclosed my resume and references.
<p />
I have earned my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Tennessee.  
I have a strong background in science and technology, and I have worked with computers all of my life.
<p />
At my current position, I was primarily hired to create and implement meaningful procedures for quality control, data and information storage, and data interpretation.  
When I started work at Powell River Labs, the procedures in effect were so poor, that I had to essentially start from scratch.  As part of my secondary duties, I am responsible for the day to day computer operations.
<p />
I am an excellent speaker and I love to interact with people.  
I am very good at explaining complex subjects in a clear and understandable manner.  
I pride myself on my patient, positive demeanor.  
<p />
I also have a long history of writing training manuals that are truly user friendly.  
I firmly believe that technology loses much of it's power if it is not adequately explained to the user.  
At my previous position, I wrote most of the reference material for the DevGuru Web site.  
DevGuru is one of the most important computer language references on the Internet and enjoys over 175 million hits per year.
<p />
I believe that I can be of great use to LAET and I look forward to hearing from you.
<p />
Sincerely yours,
<p />
