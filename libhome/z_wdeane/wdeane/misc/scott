Bill,

I'm really sorry to hear about the lay off. Are you serious about another
career change? Bummer about the wedding too, but they are young!

I'll be in Oak Ridge from Sunday to Thursday. Would be nice to see you.
Maybe you can get to Big Ed's Sunday afternoon after the LR match?

And I humbly thank you for the assessment of my tundra photo. That's the
highest praise I've ever had for my photography! Now I have to pry my hat
off before I suffer brain injury!

Hope to see you Sunday!
Scott
