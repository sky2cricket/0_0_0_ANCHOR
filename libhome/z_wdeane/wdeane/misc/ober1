Mr. Brown,
I will be happy to provide the two originals so you can produce an 8"x10".

Yes, I have some bear cub pictures that may interest you.  It will take a
day or two to search my files.

I should have everything to you by Wednesday afternoon.  Is that soon
enough?

My work phone is 220-5452.
Thank you,
Bill Deane
