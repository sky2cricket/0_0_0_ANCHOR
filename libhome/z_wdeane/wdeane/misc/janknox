Good to hear from you,

I will have a few days of vacation between meetings in October, but no 
relief until then.  It has been and continues to be a very busy fall for my 
art.  As VP of the Waterloo Watercolor Group, I have been setting up shows 
and coordinating with businesses and City as we approach our first attempt 
at a month long Visual Arts Gala for the public.  Have been successful at 
getting the Airport to agree  to showcase Austin artists, and I currently 
have two paintings showing out there until the end of November.  Then this 
past Labor Day weekend, I was hanging a two month show at the Corridor of 
Art Gallery (again this will overlap the October activities).  This was the 
first time I chaired a show and had to twist arms to get some helpers, but 
it is a relief to have the show up and looking good; now I can catch my 
breath before the next one.  I am also showing in a couple of restaurants 
here in town and still have my galleries to keep up with.  I guess the most 
exciting venue for our group is the Capitol Rotunda Art show in mid-October.

  I just stumbled into this but ....wow!!!  Very excited to get this special

show venue for the group, now I need to get busy and paint something for the

show...all my other stuff is out or committed to other upcoming shows.
The first week of October, I am taking my artists out to Ghost Ranch in New 
Mexico for another week of painting on location and day hiking.  We will 
again hit the O'Keeffe museum in  Santa Fe, and this year I was able to get 
tickets to tour the O'Keeffe house in Abiquiu.

We had the fifth annual Texas Speleological Association Labor Day Project 
down in Bustamante, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.  I didn't get to go this year, but 
painted several small watercolors from photos in the cave as awards.  Figure

that 80 percent of the graffiti has now been removed...almost all of the 
light shields are installed in the first room (where the public tours) and 
signs were installed in the cave this year discussing conservation, geology,

cave formations, and cave discovery.  Outside there was trail improvement to

the cave, trash pickup and graffiti removal.  This year the City, Coke and 
Carta Blanca Beer paid for the cost of the banquet on Sunday evening.  The 
director of tourism for Nuevo Leon was there and gave certificates out 
thanking the cavers and other volunteers for all the work during the past 5 
projects.  Orion brought back those certificates of us absentee supporters 
this year, and for those folks who have been to past projects but not this 
one.  Now I need to get those framed up, there are in color and signed by 
the senator of Nuevo Leon, the director of Tourism for the state, and the 
Mayor of Bustamante, Norma.  (yes, they have a lady major).

Now changing hats...Can't remember if I mentioned that I belong to the 
American Business Women's Association and do the newsletter for the Austin 
Chapter.  Anyway, I have won the six-state regional competition for the 
newsletter -- this is my second year to do this.  Thus, the ABWA is paying 
my way to attend the National Convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Oct. 30

- Nov 4th.  I am entered in the national competition.  Appreciate this honor

and especially the financial assistance to go.  Also being feted on 
September 13th as 'Woman of the Year' for all my work with the group, and 
again feted at the national convention at the 'Women of Year Luncheon'.  Our

keynote speaker in Albuquerque is Janet Reno, so maybe get to meet her in 
person.  Planning on having a few days before the meeting to explore the new

hiking park in the Jemez Mountains, and maybe the hot springs.

Up until two weeks again, we hadn't had a drop of rain since end of May, we 
were just trying to keep the trees alive, and been feeding hay to the cows 
starting July 4th.  In the past 10 days we have had over 13 inches of rain, 
today's estimate is 80% chance...from drought to flood.

Congratulations on the upcoming wedding...but I agree, we are too young for 
this!

I haven't gotten any further on planning next year activities except for 
booking the show locations for my art group.
