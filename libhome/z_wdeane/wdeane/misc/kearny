Thanks for the info.  Hopefully, I will be able to find out where Susan is 
and let you know.  

I wanted to let you know that a photo book can be order from the reunion and

you can see what everybody looks like.  You can also send a small picture of

yourself and it can be put into the book.  Let me know if you are
interested.
