	Mr. Deane--my apologies but I misplaced your phone number. Your slides and
transparencies are here at the front office of LAMAR in your original
envelope. If you stop by before we talk, tell whomever that your "package"
is in the PICK-UP Box within the supply room.
	Thanks again for all your help---hopefully I will relocate your number and
possibly meet you with the package rather than you having to come by here.
	Charlie Brown     789-6118
