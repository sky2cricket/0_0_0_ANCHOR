      Hi Bill,  Myke Ray here
     Talked to Jay Arnold. Thanx for the connection. Seems to me he's
pretty busy these
days. At time of conversation he said he did'nt have enough memory of
project to do
proper writing of subject other than he was an actor and played the part
of the guy
who got pooped out and needed help getting back up.
      He definetly wants copy of video.
      He did say he'd drop me a line with anything as far as his
memories and thoughts
as they come to him.
     What little I could glean from him could be interesting. Stan was
experimenting
with some fast film. Stan wrote a letter back then to one of the
Grotto's giving detail
of the fast film and results to maybe help others on making such films
in the future.
      Guess maybe text in insert should be based on everybody's
rememberances.
Answering E-mail today. Even from Europe. Folks are posting my original
letter
on websites and in print on newsletters
      Thanks for your help.             Myke
