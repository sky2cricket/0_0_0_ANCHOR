Bill:
Thnx for the e-mail on the Winding Stair film. I'd sure like to have a
copy; I gave Stan some money for a 16mm copy many years ago, but he
never produced anything.
I'll forward this to Alex Sproul, who as head of the NSS Video Salan
committee wud be most interested in getting a good video copy for the
NSS A-V cmte, or his own personal collection, I'm sure. He'd also know
other videographers who mite like a copy, as well.
Looking forward to yr post on Smoke Hole. Pls send me a copy since I'm
not on TAG-Net.
Jay
