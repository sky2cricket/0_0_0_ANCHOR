      Hi Mr.Deane,  Myke Ray here.

     Looks like I've generated plenty of interest in the video of
C.W.S.. Caver folks have
asked for my letter of interest to be posted on websites and
periodicals. I had requests for photos to go along with the letter.
     Talked to John Woods and need to talk to you about realeasing some
of your
pics for the above mentioned purposes.
     John suggested I give his and your e-mail addresses to  these
people.
     A friend put up a barebones webpage as a starter to build on about
the movie.
looks pretty cheesy now.
     Would like to put some pics on it.
     The state has gotten a little picky about me scavaging through the
material at
the park. Just sent off formal letter to the boss's, boss's boss for
permission to
find yours and Johns work for digitizing. John gave me a pretty good
lecture on
the process of getting permission from the photographers about doing
this.
     The only thing I can figure to do is didgitize the pics to CD and
send them
to both of you. Then figure out whos pics is whos. I don't dare pass the
material
on. At least we all have the pics and can determine what could be
released with
permission.
      Please advise.
                                                          Thanks,   Myke
