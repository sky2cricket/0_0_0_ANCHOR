Hi Bill,

I just received this message and thought I pass it along in its entirety
to you. I am deleting the first paragraph when I forward it to tag net
so you won't be swamped with mail..

   You might help me find a caver/photographer named Bill Dean. Last
whereabouts was Knoxville. Got lead from "Littlejohn" Woods. This
connection pertains to following:

     Hello, my name is Myke Ray. For the past four years I've worked
part time as a tour guide at Mitchell Caverns located in the Providence
Mountains of California's Mohave Desert.
     I've taken an interest in the history of the area. Even
published a booklet containing some of Jack Mitchell's short stories
and other musings.
    While doing clean-up chores inside the visitor center I've been
lucky enough to have rediscovered many "Lost Treasures" that have been
donated to the park over the years.
    One such item is a large reel of 16mm film. It was shot in 1968
and depicts a crew of folks exploring Cave of the Winding Stair ( in
the same park as Mitchell Caverns, but not open to the general public).
A very well done production with music and narration.The showing
time of the movie is approx. 25 minutes.
    After a bit of research, I contacted the fellow who produced and
directed it, and also owns the copywright. Apparently he made three
copies he'd donated to three organizations and that was it. Keep in
mind, this was before there were VCR's in every household.
    There are some video copies of the film around that were made from
one of the three donated movies. Unfortianatly the quality is poor.
A lot of scratches on the old film and a very annoying flicker due
unprofessional transfer (16mm movie is 24 frames per sec. where as
video is 30).
    The purpose of this letter is to find out how much interest there
would be in a pristine video copy made from the origional "master
positive" and audio "mag track". And to help determine the cost of
getting this video to the public. All royalties paid to the producers of
this movie will be used to support cave conservation.
    Please feel free to circulate this letter. I'd appreciate it.

                                Thanx, Myke C. Ray
