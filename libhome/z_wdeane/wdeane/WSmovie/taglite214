Mr. Deane,

Hello, I'm the Chairman of the Chattanooga Grotto of the NSS here in
Chattanooga.  Our on-line guestbook was recently signed by the gentleman
below.  A quick glimpse through the NSS Members Manual brought you up, with
an NSS number low enough to have possibly been the person Mr. Ray is looking
for.

If so, I'm sure he'd like to here from you.  If not, please excuse this
email.

Cave Softly and Carry a Long Rope - TAG!

Wm Shrewsbury, 22677RL,FE  ^v^
Chairman, Chattanooga Grotto
Senior Programmer, Tel-A-Train, a PRIMEDIA company

>>Your Comment: :    I'm trying to contact a fellow named
>>   Bill Dean who in 1968 had a lot to do
>>   with the movie I'm talking about in the
>>   text below. If he reads this, tell him
>>   "Little John" say's Hi.

>>                           Thanx, Myke

>>Hello, my name is Myke Ray. For the past four years I've worked
>>part time as a tour guide at Mitchell Caverns located in the Providence
>>Mountains of California's Mohave Desert.
>>I've taken an interest in the history of the area. Even
>>published a booklet containing some of Jack Mitchell's short stories
>>and other musings.
>>While doing clean-up chores inside the visitor center I've been
>>lucky enough to have rediscovered many "Lost Treasures" that have been
>>donated to the park over the years.
>>One such item is a large reel of 16mm film. It was shot in 1968
>>and depicts a crew of folks exploring Cave of the Winding Stair ( in
>>the same park as Mitchell Caverns, but not open to the general public).
>>A very well done production with music and narration.The showing
>>time of the movie is approx. 25 minutes.
>>After a bit of research, I contacted the fellow who produced and
>>directed it, and also owns the copywright. Apparently he made three
>>copies he'd donated to three organizations and that was it. Keep in mind,
>>this was before there were VCR's in every household.
>>There are some video copies of the film around that were made from
>>one of the three donated movies. Unfortianatly the quality is poor.
>>A lot of scratches on the old film and a very annoying flicker due
>>unprofessional transfer (16mm movie is 24 frames per sec. where as
>>video is 30).
>>The purpose of this letter is to find out how much interest there
>>would be in a pristine video copy made from the origional "master
>>positive" and audio "mag track". And to help determine the cost of
>>getting this video to the public. All royalties paid to the producers of
>>this movie will be used to support cave conservation.
>>Please feel free to circulate this letter. I'd appreciate it.
>>
>>Thanx, Myke C. Ray
