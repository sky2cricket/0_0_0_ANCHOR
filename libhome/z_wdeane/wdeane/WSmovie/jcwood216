Bill,  How's this for a voice from the past?  A Ranger named Myke Ray at
Mitchell's Caverns State Park is attempting to generate some income via
Winding Stair.  He has already received permission from Stan Ulfeldt to
video transfer and market the Winding Stair movie from 1968.  His other
intentions include your slide show of WS that we worked on in 1970.  He
thinks he can locate a copy of the show in the Mitchell's Caverns "back"
room and wants to do some sort of marketing or publication of the pix. I
have informed him (twice!)that the photos are yours, but he seems to think
that I can release the copyright to him.
One friend to another and one professional to another, I think that you
should contact him to prevent any later misunderstandings.  He seems nice
enough and his intentions are (he claims) educational.  I think he is just
a little naive as to to your professional photography status  If you're
interested, contact him at:

Myke Ray
P.O. Box 5725
Mohave Valley AZ 86446
(520) 768-4335

I'm still caving (I teach vertical at the Convention every year) and
photographing. In fact, I'm off to Arizona tomorrow to go caving for a
week. Check out my web page at:  http://home.att.net/~jcwoods

Little John would like to hear from you.  My best,


John Charles Woods
