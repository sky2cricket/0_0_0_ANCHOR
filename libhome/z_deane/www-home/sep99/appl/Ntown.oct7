Dear Christine,

Thank you for your interest in an internship position at Ntown. I 
admit we have dropped the ball on this issue. I apologize for taking 
so long to respond to your email and resume. Just a case of being a 
busy start up company and not having a chance to respond to all the 
items we start.

My question to you is, Are you looking for an internship or full time 
position? I don't have an immediate full time opening.

Yours truly,


Robert Wade

Hi Robert,

I would be happy to be considered for an internship at Ntown.  This
would actually suit me better than a full time position because I
am taking graduate coursework at UTK this semester and hope to continue
next semester.  My class schedule is:

Monday  10 - 11  Geog 411
Tues    11 - 12  CS operating systems seminar
Wed     10 - 11  Geog 411
Thurs   11 - 12  alternate meeting time for CS seminar
Fri      8 - 11  Geog 411 lab

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,
Christine Haygood Deane
