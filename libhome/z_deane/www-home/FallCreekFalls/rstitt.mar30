cricket!,

I have written a teaser blurb for the CCMS web page at
http://www.caves.org/section/ccms/default.htm.  Please check it out and let
me know if it says what you want.

I will forward your message to our "Cave Conservation" mailing list, which
has almost 100 members now, who are key activists in the NSS.  That should
generate a good response.

You may also want to put something on the Caver's Digest.  I think you need
to be a member to post.  If you are not a member, forward your tagnet post
to me and I will send it to Cavers Digest. (oops, I re-read your message and
I guess you are sending it already).
