Hi Don, 

I realize this is over a thousand miles east of your caving
area, but Fall Creek Falls is desperately in need of help.
They want to strip mine high sulfur coal in the watershed
above the falls.  Aside from being a crime against nature,
any income made by local folks is offset by longterm loss 
of tourist dollars.

Please pass this on to anyone you think might be interested.

cheers!
cricket!

Hello all TagNet Subscribers,

I just picked up a copy of the OSM Environmental Impact Statement.
Lying on its side, it is 3 inches high.  I will be reading this
and attempting to summarize it and put it on the web, but I urge
everyone to get a copy (IMMEDIATELY if not sooner) because OSM says
"supplies are limited..."  

I am making a web page about this at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/FallCreekFalls/

To obtain a copy of the Two Volume EIS, 

email:   bbrock@osmre.gov 

street address:

Beverly Brock 
Office of Surface Mining 
530 S. Gay Street 
Suite 500 
Knoxville, Tn 27902 

phone:

(865) 545-4103 
extension 146 

If that extension is not available, use "0" (zero) to speak to someone immediately. 

For an existing summary of what has happened so far:

Fall Creek Falls is the highest waterfall east of the Rockies.
Its where Bill and I got married.

Let's not let this one get destroyed so the strip miners can make
a few bucks mining HIGH SULFUL coal that will cause air pollution
when burned.

cheers!
