Bats, Trash, and Pee
      By: James Greene  (Cookeville, Tennessee)
          farout99@usit.net



The TAG-Net postings have been a bit slim the past few days so I thought I
would post one. Last week saw me make two trips to Camp's Gulf Cave in Van
Buren County, TN. Both were unplanned. Last Thursday, I had a couple of
hours to kill so I made a quick trip down to the cave from Cookeville, TN. I
had been intending to get the old clothing out of the pool in the right hand
passage in the front of the cave. I fished the clothes (it turned out to be
an old, denim shirt...rotted...) out of the pool with a jerry-rigged coat
hanger and some nylon webbing.
    Now--The main reason I write:
    I had a novice caver with me and I thought since the "shirt recovery"
had gone so well we should quietly visit the "bat-cave" portion of the cave
and check out the gray bat situation. We dropped our packs in the main trunk
and began stealth caving into the bat cave. I noticed some green moss,
pretty fresh, laying in passage. Hummmmm..... Then we passed under the
"Closed for endangered bats...." sign which is neatly bolted right across
the access passage--then when we emerged into the room--SURPRISE!
    There was a whole branch from a tree, about 12 feet in length, leaves,
MOSS, bark, the works. Great..... There were a coupl'a cans laying near the
tree and the best part?....There was even remains of a small fire where
"they" (whoever "they" may be....) had tried to burn the green, wet tree
branch. We also discovered a broken Jim Beam bottle where the visitor had
thrown it against the wall and shattered it into tiny pieces--right beneath
the largest concentration of grays in the cave. This is most disturbing.
    Rather than gawk at bats as planned--we began quietly searching the
entire passage for the presence of bats. My fear was that the smoke and
noise from the careless visitors had awakened and/or killed the grays. We
discovered around 12-15 grays and dozens of browns still "hanging around,"
thankfully. A narrow escape, I'm sure.
    We did NOT attempt to clean any of this mess. I felt that the noise
would be too great. We did, however, attempt to empty the trash barrel in
the camping area outside the cave.  I filled up three gargage bags (all I
had) and left the can half full. {{NOTE--Someone in Spencer Mountain Grotto:
The can does not have drain holes in the bottom and the can fills up with
water.  It was one of the nastiest things I have EVER tried to clean. You
guys, or me, or someone from my grotto (the UCG) needs to drill a couple of
drain holes in the can.}}
    Now I am not sure what the proper etiquette is for zip lock bags full of
pee. BUT--when emptying the trash can (by hand--yuck!) I found a bag of what
looked suspiciously like HUMAN PEE! Look--if you're gonna pee in plastic
bags in the cave--don't just drop them into the can without first emptying
them. Your fellow cavers actually empty that can and we really don't want to
handle your bodily fluids. It's great that you don't pee in the cave and
all---but DUMP the bags on the ground before tossing them into the can
please. I don't think that 6 ounces of urine on the ground will damage the
Karst system--but 6 ounces of urine in the trash can is pretty gross....
    Trip two was a "salvage the day" trip as our other trip fell through.
David and Kristin Bobo, Greg and Jackie King, Andrew and Nora Dickins and
myself found ourselves in the Camp's Gulf area on Sunday with time, gear,
and failed caving plans. Soooooooo--we bounced a small pit that Mark Moore
and Jerell Killian found this time last year. The pit is called "Killbilly
Cave" and I don't think it's turned in yet. It is about 40 feet down to a
small room with a pool in it. The pool leads, chest deep, to a breakdown
wall. Then we went on down to Camp's Gulf as most people in our group had
never visited the right hand passages of the cave before. We got nice and
muddy and crawled around in some tight squeezes. We had a relaxed tourist
cave day.
    That's it for this long post...

FallCreekFalls HELP
      By: Cricket Deane  (Knoxville, Tennessee)
          deane@cs.utk.edu



Hello all TagNet Subscribers,

I just picked up a copy of the OSM Environmental Impact Statement.
Lying on its side, it is 3 inches high.  I will be reading this
and attempting to summarize it and put it on the web, but I urge
everyone to get a copy (IMMEDIATELY if not sooner) because OSM says
"supplies are limited..."  

I am making a web page about this at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/FallCreekFalls/

To obtain a copy of the Two Volume EIS, 

email:   bbrock@osmre.gov 

street address:

Beverly Brock 
Office of Surface Mining 
530 S. Gay Street 
Suite 500 
Knoxville, Tn 27902 

phone:

(865) 545-4103 
extension 146 

If that extension is not available, use "0" (zero) to speak to someone immediately. 

For an existing summary of what has happened so far:

http://www.tngreen.com/land/News/Plea.html

Fall Creek Falls is the highest waterfall east of the Rockies.
Its where Bill and I got married.

Let's not let this one get destroyed so the strip miners can make
a few bucks mining HIGH SULFUL coal that will cause air pollution
when burned.

cheers!
cricket!

News
      By: Allen Padgett  (Lafayette, Georgia)

On Sunday evening March 26 at 6 PM Rangers with the Georgia Department of 
Natural Resources arrested two persons for breaking into a vehicle at the 
Rocktown Trail head on Pigeon Mountain. The stakeout captured the event on 
video tape and the subjects were arrested leaving the scene. The arrested are 
still in the Walker County Georgia Jail and the investigation continues with 
the help of detectives with the Walker County Sheriffs Office. Evidence from 
at least eight break-ins in the Pigeon mountain area has been recovered with 
more to follow. The arrested persons were two brothers in their early 
twenties from the Ringgold area and were "cavers and rock climbers."  There 
were bat stickers and climbing decals on their vehicles. One had a previous 
conviction for breaking into cars. Their primary method of moving the stolen 
gear was to go to a pawn shop in the area. 
    Cavers and climbers need to be aware that there are thieves among us and 
help stop this problem. What can each one of us do?
     1. Don't EVER buy used gear especially from a pawn shop. It is stolen! 
     2. Report any theft to the proper authorities.
     3. Mark ALL of your gear with your  name. Use a magic marker on tents, 
sleeping  
         bags, harnesses,  helmets, etc. Use an electric vibrating etching 
pencil to  
         mark all hardware( Do not use the hammer strike type marking)
     4. When you park don't leave stuff out as bait. Wallets on dashboards, 
CD cases 
         on backseats are common targets of theives.
Crime in the backcountry is rare but it does occur. Rangers and other law 
enforcement officers take it seriously and are trying to help if you will do 
your part.

Safe cavin, and climbin

          CaverGrace@aol.com



I am asking for information on the best GPS system that cavers have found.  
This includes best for the cost and just "the best".  I am going to be buying 
one soon and would like the input from cavers who actually use them.  Send me 
the information offlist to cavergrace@aol.com  Thanks

Yum, Yum, Get Ya Some!!
      By: Lesley Weldon  (Atlanta, Georgia)
          lesleyw@mindspring.com



Saturday, Brad Long and I met up with Andy Porter, Shari Lydy, Paul Aughey
and Doug Strait at Devil's Pocket Too, TN. Andy wanted to survey and
possibly survey Devil's Pocket as well. The cave was a nice find for sure.
It contains a 90-115ft (depending on where you rig). We didn't do the pit,
but did a traverse across the pit. This is done by rappelling and at the
same time pulling yourself over to the rebelay, switching over to climb,
climbing up to the bolt, passing the next bolt and climbing to the top. It
was really fun, even if slightly butt clenching. After caving and surveying,
the gang was pretty hungry. Of course, the suggestion of Mexican came up but
we were all in the mood for something different. Oriental maybe. I  had been
curious about the new Chinese restaurant in Kimball. Andy said he had been
there and it wasn't good, it was GREAT! So to Kimball we went. The Kimball
Chinese Buffet is located next to the Quik Trip (across from Wendy's). Nice
decor, quick and attentive service. The buffet consisted of THREE buffet
tables filled with fresh, incredible food. Everything from boiled shrimp,
mussels, soups, 10 different entrees, 3 kinds of rice, 2 kinds of eggrolls
to ice cream, cheese cake, and gummy bears. It rivals any buffet in Atlanta!
The cost is $8.99 for dinner- all you can eat. You can also order off the
menu. A much better choice than the crappy Three Amigos. Go soon- the food
is high quality, they may either go out of business or the quality may
decline. This IS NOT A SOLICITATION, just a bit of info for hungry cavers.

Highlights of the Spring SCCi Board Meeting
      By: Kenneth Huffines  (Stone_Mountain, Georgia)
          khuffines@mindspring.com



The Southeastern Cave Conservancy held it's quarterly Board meeting in
Scottsboro, Alabama last Saturday, March 25.  Here's the highlights of the
meeting:

Attendance: Seven of the nine Board members, all Officers, and about 10
members and guests.

The SCCi accepted a donation of $2600 from the 1998 NSS Convention
Management Committee and $300 from SERA.  Lynn Roebuck and Kenneth
Huffines, award winners at SERA, donated the $50 cash portion of their
awards to the SCCi.

Up to $400 was allocated to expand the booth from 18 x 20 feet to 18 x 40.
(This will allow us the flexibility of setting it up as a 18 x 20, 18 x 30,
or 18 x 40).  Four tables and another light are also to be bought.

The Board clarified the policy on SCCi publications.  SCCi publications,
paper or other, will contain only material pertinent to SCCi business
affairs.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Board of
Directors.  However, any existing mention of non-SCCi business may remain in
place.

The Emergency Management Committee was created and staffed by Diane
Cousineau, Buddy Lane, and Bill Putnam.  They will produce guidelines for
handling emergencies on SCCi preserves.

Up to $500 was allocated to repair the creek crossing on our road to the
Fricks preserve.  It has been washed out for some time.  Getting it fixed
is the first step in restoring the entire road.

Lane Steel agreed to donate the metal necessary to repair the vandalized
gate at Hardin's cave.  $150 was allocated for a new lock.

The Board authorized the Acquisition Chair to pursue a parcel of land south
of the Fox Mountain Preserve in order to pick up two entrances to a cave
that underlies the preserve.  The recent survey shows one of the entrances
to be a mere 2.4 feet off our line!

The Big Coon Valley Task Force and the Volunteer Coordination Committee
were dissolved.

Money was allocated for water quality studies for the Fox Mountain and
Fricks Preserves.

That's all from the meeting.

In further news, we are paying down the loan on the Fricks Cave Preserve.
So far in FY '99, we've made a total of $24,600 in payments.  We're paying
$4,800 per month in order to have the loan paid off in time for the Annual
Member's meeting, to be held on June 17.

- Kenneth Huffines,
Board member and Secretary, SCCi
