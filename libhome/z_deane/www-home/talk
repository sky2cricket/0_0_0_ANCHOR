Greetings colleagues.

John Feo (who is a really good speaker and was my Ph.D. advisor) will
be speaking tomorrow (Thursday) at 3:00 PM.  I'm including an abstract of
his talk at the end of this message.  If you are free and you
are interested, I would love it if you would attend and give
me your feedback.  

Be seeing you

(I hope)

TITLE:          The Tera MTA
SPEAKER:     	Dr. John Feo
WHEN:           3:00 p.m., Thursday, September 23, 1999
WHERE:        	Room 223 of the University Center
	      	UT Campus

The commercial availability of MPP and clustered SMP systems have made
very high peak performance systems readily available to scientists.
However, the difficulty of programming for data locality and the
limitations of medium- and coarse-grain parallelisms have limited the
usefulness of these systems. The Tera MTA is a scalable, shared memory,
multithreaded computer that supports very fine-grain synchronization.
It has no local memory and no caches. Each processor is 128 virtual
processors feeding a single instruction pipeline. As long as one of
the virtual processors can issue an instruction every cycle, the
processor remains fully utilized. Thus, parallelism is the only
limiting factor on the MTA. Data locality, granularity, and task
scheduling for load balancing are non-issues. The MTA sustains high
execution rates over a wide spectrum of applications, while reducing
programming costs and encouraging parallel algorithm development.

In this talk, Dr. Feo will prove a relationship between memory latency,
bandwidth, and parallelism that is the basis of multi-threaded
architectures. He will present a logical veiw of the MTA processor
as well as give machine specifications. He will describe how one
programs the machine, show two novel programming tools developed
by Tera, and give performance results.
