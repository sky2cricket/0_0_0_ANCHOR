NOTE:  You must have cgi permission from your local system
administrator to run cgi scripts.  Contact your local system
administrator for details.

Most programs here are based on information in the book, "Learning Perl",
by Schwartz and Christiansen, O'Reilly press.
<p>
Perl Programming.
<br>These programs are arranged in order of difficulty.  If you are a
beginning perl programmer, you should look at the code for each one.
I provide program.txt files so you can look at the code on your web
page and print/copy it as you choose.  This way you can 
start with a working program and modify it into something new and 
different that is limited only by your own imagination. 
<p>
HTML Programming.
<br>If you are a beginning with HTML web pages, check out the link 
<a href="BuildHomepage.cgi">BuildHomepage.cgi</a>. 
This web page is a perl program that will help you create a simple
homepage in less than 2 minutes.  You will be able to view your
page, read the HTML code, download the HTML code, and revise the
code as you choose.
The page you create has one internet link, so that you will have an
example of how this process is written.  The HTML source code is 
diplayed and available for printing or copying. If your browser 
has view source or download, you can apply these also.

<a target="window" href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/cgi-bin/p2/netConcepts.html">netConcepts.html</a> This example will give a display of the Host Name for the machine where the current instance of your web browser is running.  When you click  on the submit button on the netConcepts.html page, it invokes the program netConcepts.cgi.

href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/cgi-bin/p2/getHostAddresses">Code for getHostAddresses</a> This is a perl program rather than a perl-cgi script.
This is where I figured out how to use perl to get the address 
parameters for HostInfo.cgi.
