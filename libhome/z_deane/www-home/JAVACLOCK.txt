Building a Crude Clock
By David Wall

JavaScript keeps track of dates and times in an unusual way. JavaScript 
thinks of a particular date and time as a single number - the number of 
milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 12:00:01 AM. A millisecond is 
1/1000 of a second.

Needless to say, thinking of dates and times in this way is awkward for 
most people who are comfortable referring to dates as dates - November 
1, 1997, for example. The JavaScript method of managing dates has its 
advantages though, and besides, JavaScript gives you some tools for 
converting "people time" into "JavaScript time" and vice-versa. The 
following exercises show you the ropes of telling time with the 
JavaScript Date object.

By means of the Date object, JavaScript makes it easy for you to access 
the current date and time, as defined by the system clock in the 
surfer's computer. This exercise shows you the barest essentials of the 
date object-including how to create an instance of it and how to format 
it in a basic way-by creating a very simple, semi-useful clock.

    <.HTML>
    <.HEAD>
    <.TITLE>Displaying The Date and Time<./TITLE>
    <.SCRIPT LANGUAGE = "JavaScript">
    function UpdateDate()
    {
    var Today = new Date
    document.DateForm.TodaysDate.value = Today.toLocaleString()
    }
    <./SCRIPT>
    <./HEAD>
    <.BODY>
    <.H1>The Current Date and Time<./H1>
    <.FORM NAME = "DateForm">
    <.P>The Local Time and Date: <.INPUT TYPE = "TEXT" NAME 
        = "TodaysDate" VALUE = " " SIZE = "17">
    <.P><.INPUT TYPE = BUTTON VALUE = "Update" onClick = "UpdateDate()">
    <./FORM>
    <./BODY>
    <./HTML>

The interesting action in this exercise takes place in the UpdateDate() 
function. In that function, you see this line:

    var Today = new Date

That creates a new variable called Today, and makes it an instance of 
the Date object. Whenever you create an instance of the Date object, it 
automatically contains information about the current date and time.

Then, you see this line:

    document.DateForm.TodaysDate.value = Today.toLocaleString()

That line sets the text field on the page equal to Today. But since 
Today is only a number (the number of milliseconds since January 1, 
1970, 12:00:01 AM), some formatting is needed. The toLocaleString() 
method of the Date object formats the date and time like something like 
this (the actual appearance depends upon the surfer's computer and the 
surfer's country's way of formatting dates and times):

    05/05/01 01:24:31

That's not a great-looking format for a date, but it's better than the 
JavaScript native format. At least you know what it means. You'll learn 
how to format dates more attractively later in this chapter
