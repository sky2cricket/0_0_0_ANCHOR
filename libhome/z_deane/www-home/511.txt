> The worm, known to virus experts as VBS.VBSWG2, and dubbed Homepage, has
> been reported at scores of companies, according to antivirus vendors who
> say it is likely to hit more firms today. 
> According to experts, the worm will not cause damage to the computer
> system that receives the initial e-mail, but could bring down corporate
> mail servers by sending out thousands of copies of itself. 
> Experts also say that it is moving at a formidable rate. MessageLabs, a UK
> company that tracks the spread of computer viruses and worms, says that
> since yesterday evening it has seen more than 8000 copies of the Homepage
> pass through its servers. 
> Similarities to Kournikova
> "Early propogation reports indicate that this virus is spreading faster
> than many of the biggest viruses we saw last year", says Mikko Hypponen of
> Finnish antivirus firm F-Secure. "It's seems to be spreading faster like
> Anna Kournikova". 
> Antivirus vendor Symantec said that last night more than 30 companies
> reported receiving the worm. UK-based antivirus company Sohpos reported
> that 40 of its corporate customers have been hit so far and F-Secure said
> it has received over 30 reports. 
> The e-mail spreading the worm claims to contain a page that is guaranteed
> to become the next Internet craze. It has the subject line "Homepage", and
> the message, "Hi! You've got to see this page. It's really cool ;o)". 
> The attached file--homepage.html.vbs--is not an html document, but a
> malicious Visual Basic script. Once executed, the script will forward the
> same e-mail on to all the people in a victim's address book and
> automatically open one of four pornographic Web pages on the user's
> computer. 
> According to experts, the malicious e-mail attachment uses similar code to
> the Kournikova worm, which spread quickly around the world in February by
> encouraging victims to click on a supposed picture of the Russian tennis
> star Anna Kournikova. 
> Graham Cluley, head of research at Sophos, said the new worm illustrates
> that users need to be alert to the danger of e-mail attachments. "It's not
> even a particularly clever bit of social engineering," he says. "It just
> says 'this is cool'." 
> What is most disturbing about the success of the Homepage worm, according
> to Cluley, is that many companies are still not blocking Visual Basic
> attachments from entering the company--they could easily do so with basic
> filtering technology. 
> Eric Chien, chief researcher at Symantec's Antivirus Research Centre
> (SARC), predicts that Homepage will be seen at more companies today. "The
> average corporate customer will probably see it on their mail server," he
> said.
