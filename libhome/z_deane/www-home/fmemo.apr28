QUOTE OF THE WEEK:

A highly recruited high school football player was 
visiting several SEC colleges.

His first stop was at the University of Florida.

As the recruit was sitting in Coach Spurrier's office, 
he noticed a gold telephone sitting on Spurrier's desk. 
He said "Coach, what is that gold telephone?" Spurrier 
replied, "That is a direct line to Heaven."

The recruit asked if he could make a call. Spurrier told 
him he could, but the toll would be $20,000 dollars. 
The recruit said that was more than he could afford and he left.

>From there, the recruit went to the University of Alabama.

He was in Coach Dubose's office and he noticed that 
there was also a gold telephone sitting on his desk. He 
said, "Coach, what is that gold telephone?" Dubose told 
him that it was a direct line to Heaven.

The recruit asked how much it would cost to make a call 
and Dubose told him, "$15,000 dollars". The recruit said 
that was more than he could afford and left.

>From there, the recruit went to Georgia. He was in Coach 
Donnan's office and, once again he noticed that there 
was a gold telephone sitting on the desk. The recruit 
said, "Coach, what is that gold telephone?"

Donnan said that it was a direct line to Heaven. 
The recruit asked how much it would cost to make a 
call and Donnan told him, "$75,000 dollars". The
recruit was astonished at the enormous price that it 
cost to call Heaven and left.

>From there the recruit went to the University of Tennessee.

While he was sitting in Coach Fulmer's office, he 
noticed a gold telephone on his desk. He said, "Coach, 
I bet that gold telephone is a direct line to
Heaven." Coach Fulmer told him he was absolutely right.

The recruit then asked how much it would cost to make a 
call. Coach Fulmer replied, "35 cents." "35 cents! 
They want $20,000 dollars at the University of Florida, 
$75,000 at Georgia and $15,000 dollars at the University 
of Alabama.!

Why is it only 35 cents here at Tennessee?"

Coach Fulmer replied, "Son, it is just a local call from here."


QUICK WIT:

WIFE:     "There's trouble with the car. It has water in the 
carburetor."

HUSBAND:  "Water in the carburetor?  That's ridiculous."

WIFE:     "I tell you the car has water in the carburetor."

HUSBAND:  "You don't even know what a carburetor is.  I'll          
check it out. Where's the car?"

WIFE:     "In the pool."
