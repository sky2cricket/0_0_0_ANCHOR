Subject: new 6bone hookup web page
Sender: owner-6bone@ISI.EDU
Precedence: bulk
Status: R

I've just fixed the hookup page

	http://www.6bone.net/6bone_hookup.html

to reflect the new address changes (thanks to Marc Blanchet for reminding
me of this :-).

Please take a look and recommend corrections.  It would be nice to get
better info on setting up the DNS as well.


Thanks,

Bob
