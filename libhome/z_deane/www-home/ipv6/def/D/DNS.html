Domain Name System (DNS)
<p>
The DNS is a general purpose distributed, replicated, data query
service.  The principal use is the lookup of host IP addresses
based on host names.  The style of host names now used in the
Internet is called "domain name", because they are the style of
names used to look up anyting in the DNS.  Some important domains
are: .COM (commercial), .EDU (educational), .NET (network 
operations), .GOV (U.S. government), and .MIL (U.S. military).
Most countries also have a domain.  The country domain names are
based on ISO 3166.  For example, .US (United States), .UK (United
Kingdom), .AU (Australia).  See also: Fully Qualified Domain Name,
Mail Exchange Record.
