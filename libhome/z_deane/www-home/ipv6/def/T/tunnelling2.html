tunneling
<p>
IP packets can travel through other protocol
areas if the entire packet (header plus data)
is treated as 100% data and encapsulated within
local packet protocols.  In this way, IPv6 packets
can travel through IPv4 segments of the networks.
The process is called tunneling.  In some cases
tunneling is performed through same protocol
networks (i.e. tunneling IPv4 packets through
an IPv4 network).
