worm
<p>
A computer program which replicates itself and is self-propogating.
Worms, as opposed to viruses, are meant to spawn in network
environments.  Network worms were first defined by Shoch and Hupp
of Xerox in ACM Communications (March 1982).  The Internet
worm of November 1988 is perhaps the most famous; it successfully
propagated itself on over 6000 systems across the Internet.
See also: Trojan Horse, virus.
(From RFC1983.)
