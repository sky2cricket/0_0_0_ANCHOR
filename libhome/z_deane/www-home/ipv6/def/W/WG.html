Working Group (WG)
<p>
A working group, within the IETF, is a group of people who work
under a charter to achieve a certain goal.  That goal may be the
creation of an Informational document, the creation of a protocol 
specification, or the resolution of problems in the Internet.
Most working groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once a
working group has achieved its goal, it disbands.  There is no
official membership for a working group.  Unofficially, a working
group member is somebody who is on that working group's mailing
list; however, anyone may attend a working group meeting.
