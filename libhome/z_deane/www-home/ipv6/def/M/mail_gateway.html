mail gateway 
<p>
A machine that connects two or more electronic mail systems 
(including dissimilar mail systems) and transfers messages between
them. Sometimes the mapping and translation can be quite complex,
and it generally requires a store-and-forward schemem whereby the
message is received from one system completely before it is 
transmitted to the next system, after suitable translation.
