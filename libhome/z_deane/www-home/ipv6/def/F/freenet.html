freenet
<p>
   Community-based bulletin board system with email, information
      services, interactive communications, and conferencing.  Freenets
      are funded and operated by individuals and volunteers -- in one
      sense, like public television.  They are part of the National
      Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN), an organization based in
      Cleveland, Ohio, devoted to making computer telecommunication and
      networking services as freely available as public libraries.
