circuit switching
<p>
A communications paradigm in which a dedicated communication path
is established between two hosts, and on which all packets travel.
The telephone system is an example of a circuit switched network.
See also: connection-oriented, connectionless, packet switching.
(From RFC1983.) 
<hr>
<p>
A method of communicating in which a dedicated 
communications path is established between the two
devices through one or more intermediate switching nodes. 
Unlike packet switching, digital data are sent as a
continuous stream of bits.  Data rate is guarenteed, and
delay is essentially limited to propagation time.
