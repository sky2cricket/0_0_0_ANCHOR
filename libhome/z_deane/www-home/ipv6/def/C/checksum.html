checksum
<p>
A computed value which is dependent upon the contents of a packet.
This value is sent along with the packet when it is transmitted.
The receiving system computes a new checksum based upon the 
received data and compares this value with the one sent with the
packet.  If the two values are the same, the receiver has a high
degree of confidence that the data was received correctly.  See
also: Cyclic Redundancy Check. [Source: NNSC]
