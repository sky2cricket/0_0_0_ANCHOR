urban legend
<p>
A story, which may have started with a grain of truth, that has
been embroidered and retold until  it has passed into the realm of 
myth.  It is an interesting phenomenon that these stories get 
spread so far, so fast, and so often.  Urban legends never die,
they just end up on the Internet!  Some legends that periodically
make their rounds include "The Infamous Modem Tax" and "The $250
Cookie Recipe." [Source: LAQUEY]
