Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)
<p>
A pioneering longhaul network funded by ARPA.  Now retired, it
served as the basis for early networking research as well as a 
central backbone during the development of the Internet.  The 
ARPANET consisted of individual pack switching computers 
interconnected by leased lines.  See also:  Advanced Research
Projects Agency. [Sourcy FYI4.]
