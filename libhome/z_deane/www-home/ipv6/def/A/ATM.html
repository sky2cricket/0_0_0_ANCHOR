Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
<p>
A standard which defines high-load, high-speed (1.544Mbps through
      1.2Gbps), fixed-size packet (cell) switching with dynamic
      bandwidth allocation.  ATM is also known as "fast packet."
(From RFC1983.)
<hr>
<p>
In this method of data
transmission, the data is packed into packets called cells and 
a virtual circuit is established so that all of the cells follow
the same path.  Each cell has the same size (53 octets = 53x8 bits).
There is no "ack" with ATM, so there is no automatic mechanism
to resend a packet if an error is detected.  ATM is used on 
B-ISDN.
