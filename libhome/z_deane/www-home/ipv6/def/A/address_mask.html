address  mask              
<p>
A bit mask used to identify which bits in an IP address correspond
to the network and subnet portions of the address.  This mask is
often referred to as the subnet mask because the network portion 
of the address (i.e., the network mask) can be determined by the
encoding inherent in an IP address.  See aslo: Classless Interdomain
Routing.
(From RFC1983.)
