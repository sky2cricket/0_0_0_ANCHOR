big-endian
<p>
A format for storage or transmission of binary data in which the
most significant bit (or byte) comes first.  The term comes from
"Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift.  The Lilliputians, being
very small, had correspondingly small political problems.  The
Big-Endian and Little-Endian parties debated over wheter soft-boiled
eggs should be opened at the big end or the little end.  See also:
little-endian.
