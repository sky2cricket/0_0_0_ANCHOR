Bulletin Board System (BBS)
<p>
A computer, and associated software, which typically provides 
electronic messaging services, archives of files, and any other
services or activities of interest to the bulletin board system's
operator.  Although BBSs have traditionally been the domain of
hobbyists, an increasing number of BBSs are connected directly to
the Internet, and many BBSs are currently operated by government,
educational, and research institutions.  See also:  Electronic
Mail, Internet, Usenet. [Source: NWNET]
