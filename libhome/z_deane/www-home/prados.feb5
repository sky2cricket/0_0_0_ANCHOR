Hi Cricket!

How are you doing these days? Attached is an email from a friend of mine
who is looking for a summer intern. I don't know if you would be
interested, but when she said she was looking for someone good in JAVA, I
thought of you! 

Thanks!

Laura

Laura:

Do you remember me from different places?  Unless you moved, we still live
in the same neighbourhood on either side of Francis Road.

I now work at ORNL-CSM, and am looking to hire a student with
knowledge of java programming for a Summer 3-month paid internship at
ORNL.  The student would learn about agent-oriented architectures (my
research area) and develop a prototype.  Agent-oriented systems are very
hot in e-commmerce.  I was wondering if you may recommend someone.   

I understand that java programmers are in tight supply at UT.  In
addition, because of ORNL regulations, I am not allowed to advertise.  The
student will have to apply through the ORISE interface at 
www.orau.gov/hereatornl by Feb. 15, and mention my name under Field 27 in 
the application package.  I can push it at this end.

Please let me know if someone comes to your mind.  And I'd like to get
back in touch if you are interested.
