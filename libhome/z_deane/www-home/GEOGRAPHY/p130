1. Based on what you have seen so far, which world regions would
   you eliminate as possible photo shoot locations?

   Not North America or Europe or Scandanavia or the Cold part 
   of Russia [ Siberia and regions of Moscow and north of Moscow ]
   due to the clothing on the people and the vegatation cover.

   Not Antarctic due to how warm it looks.

   Need to find a place with
	a. sparse vegetation, but not total desert
	b. warm climate
	c. an urban area with lots of buildings plus
           a mideavil looking low wall around the city
        d. women wear bright bedouin clothes  


2. For photo location, look at 
	a. arabian penninsula
	b. north africa
        c. other moslem areas -- pakistan, tadzikistan, etc.


3.  The people in the image.  It appears to be a mother and a
    daughter going to market or to school.  This eliminates
    Sauidi Arabia, since they are unescorted females.  

4.  The economic landscape: 
    This is an urban area, the people have access to electricity 
    and television and probably every other modern thing.

5.  The level of technology is modern. The economy is industrialized
    to a point ( they use modern oil drilling equipment ), but
    it is hard to tell how extensive this industrial modernization is
    from just one picture.

6.  I think this cover photo is from the walled capital city of Yeman,
    Sama'a because...

    a. There is  a mideval looking wall around the city.
    b.
