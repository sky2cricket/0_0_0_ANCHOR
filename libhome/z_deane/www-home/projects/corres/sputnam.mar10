Dear Christine,

So glad you attended the Colloquium and heard about HIT/SPOT/MAPMAKER.  The
interviewing for Computer Specialist has begun but we are taking applications
still, since qualified candidates with experience are hard to find.  Please apply
-- we need a CV, transcript and letter of application.  Then we will schedule a
time for you to meet with me and others at the CHRG, including a presentation of
your work -- a show and tell if possible.  We'll have the ability for you to show
your work live or you might want to present some in Powerpoint or  another
format.

Look forward to hearing from you.  All the best.
