she is applying to snmp--did her ms under me.  her husband works in
knoxville at ISSI--got his MS about the same time, one daughter at UT,
another with a CS degree (more or less, from maryland CP).  she has
excellent skills in networking, perl, java, and C++.  she was my
head GTA for several years.  excellent at documentation--writes very
clearly and coherently--unlike some people.  strong interest in
continung to learn--does not like to sit on her current skills.  lives
of the chapman hwy in south knoxville.  very highly recommended.
