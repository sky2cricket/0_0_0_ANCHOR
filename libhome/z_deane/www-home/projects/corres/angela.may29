Oh dear.  Sounds like a bad situation.

My new address is 3200 Windy Hill Lane, Atlanta, GA, 30339.  
You can specify IBM, 10th floor.  Don't know my cube number.

I'll email my phone number at work when I get to work tomorrow.  
I dont' remember it now.  Work email is aklaus@us.ibm.com.

Having a great time thus far.  Tons of work, though.  
I may be in over my head.

Do you have my new Atlanta info?  

617 Windy Ridge Lane, Atlanta, 30339.  
770-951-0678.  mobile 770-605-6621 (it's on a lot).  

Hope you had a great weekend.  Come visit sometime.

Angela

Hope all is going well for you at new position.  I am now
officially job hunting.  When I was hired, I was told that
the "temp" position was a formality and that at the very
latest August 1 , I would be made full time peremanant postion.
Now Putnam says she simply doesn't remember saying any such
thing.

So I simply do not wish to work for someone with such a
poor memory.

Plus she dropped a boat load of crap on me because I was taking
Friday afternoon off. (Bill had minor surgery, that went fine, and
he needed me to drive him there.)  But rather than rant and rave 
about Putnam, I will put my energy into the job hunt.

I need a new address for you ( the one I have now is Arinc ).

cheers!
cricket!
