Dear Thad and Doyle,
 
Thanks for resending the attachment.  I have read both the offer and
the non-disclosure agreement.  Being of sound mind, I very happily
accept the offer.
 
I will come by in the morning to sign papers (cannot print here).
 
I would like to start Monday August 14, 2000.
 
cheers!
cricket!
