Dr. Jeff Case
SNMP Research International
3001 Kimberlin Heights Road
Knoxville, TN, 37920-9716

Dear Dr. Case,

Dr. David Straight told me that you were looking for people.
I am interested in seeing what opportunities there might
be for me at SNMP.  I visited you once before while I was
still a graduate student in Computer Science.

I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at UTK in 
August 1998.  I have skills in c, c++, perl, javascript, java 
and other programming languages.  I have worked on UNIX, Linux,
Windows95/98/NT platforms including cross platform development. 

I have also had coursework and worked with ESRI ArcView GIS
mapping database products. 

My resume, with references, is at:
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/resume.html

Online samples of my work may be seen at:
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/projects/          

The website for my current job is at:
http://web.utk.edu/~chrg/hit/main/index.htm

I am currently working as webmaster for the Community Health 
Research Group at UTK.  This web site provides a warehouse of 
online Tennessee State Health Reports, interactive sas query 
capability, and interactive GIS mapping capability.  My
main responsibility is to integrate the site.  I just finished
a "site map" project to help new users navigate the site.
This is an interesting and satisfying job, but a temporary
appointment with no benefits, which is one of the reasons
I am sending you this note.  This group does not know that
I am job hunting and I would prefer that you not contact 
them.  My current salary is $40,000 per annum.  

My second reason for contacting you is that I would like to
work in network programming.  My computer science coursework 
includes unix network programming and independent studies on
IPv6 and ATM. My master's project is an online teaching tool 
about building internet packets.  My job experience to date
does not include network programming, but this is the area 
where I would like to be working. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,
Cricket Haygood Deane
