                       Characteristics:
                                    Hoax



                     Description: 

                     The following two messages have been sent out by email. They are both versions
                     of the same hoax. This "virus" does not exist.

                     The hoax message includes one of the following "warnings": 


                          Dear All,
                          For your reference, take necessary precautions.  
                          If you receive an email with a file called 
                          California, do not open the file.  The file 
                          contains WOBBLER virus.

                          WARNING
                          This information was announced yesterday morning 
                          from IBM; AOL states that this is a very 
                          dangerous virus, much worse than "Melissa", and 
                          that there is NO remedy for it at this time.  
                          Some very sick individual has succeeded in using 
                          the reformat function from Norton Utilities 
                          causing it to completely erase all documents 
                          on the hard drive.  It has been designed to work 
                          with Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet 
                          Explorer.  It destroys Macintosh and IBM 
                          compatible computers.  This is a new, very 
                          malicious virus and not many people know about it.

                     Second sample of hoax message "warning": 


                          VIRUS ALERT

                          If you receive an email with a file called 
                          "California" do not open the file. The file contains 
                          the virus. This information was announced yesterday 
                          morning by IBM.

                          The report says that  "this is a very dangerous 
                          virus, much worse than "Melissa" and there is NO 
                          remedy for it at this time. Some very sick 
                          individual has succeeded in using the reformat function 
                          from Norton Utilities causing it to completely erase 
                          all documents on the hard drive. It has been 
                          designed to work with Netscape Navigator and 
                          Microsoft Internet Explorer. It destroys Macintosh 
                          and IBM compatible computers. This is a new, very 
                          malicious virus and not many people know about it 
                          at this time.

                          Please pass this warning to everyone in your address 
                          book and share it with all your online friends asap 
                          so that the destruction it can cause may be minimized.

                     Please ignore any messages regarding this "hoax" and do not pass on any
                     messages regarding it. Passing on messages about this hoax serves only to further
                     propagate it.
