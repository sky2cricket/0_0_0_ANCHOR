Hi Christine,

Thanks for the quick response.  After you and meet tomorrow afternoon,
you will also be meeting one on one with several of my engineers and
they will be conducting the indepth technical interview with you.  As I
said on the telephone, the purpose of the technical interview is to
identify where you and Cisco have common ground with respect to your
education, experience and objectives and Cisco's needs.  I look forward
to meeting with you tomorrow.

Thanks-
Rob
