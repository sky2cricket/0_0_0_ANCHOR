Dear Mr. Sargent,     

This note is a follow-up on our phone call this morning.

I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at UTK in 
August 1998.  I have skills in c, c++, perl, javascript, java 
and other programming languages.  I have worked on UNIX, Linux,
Windows95/98/NT platforms including cross platform development. 
My computer science coursework includes unix network programming 
and independent studies on IPv6 and ATM. My master's project is 
an online teaching tool about building internet packets.  

My job experience to date does not include network programming, 
but this is the area where I would like to be working.  I have
over 5 years experience in c programming.  

My resume is at:  http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/resume.html

My online portfolio is at: http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/projects/          

I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at 4 p.m.

Yours truly,
Christine Haygood Deane
