XML and JSP: Make them work together
By Mark Johnson

Sun Microsystems created JSP (JavaServer Pages) technology for building 
Web pages on the fly on a server. Sun's original dynamic content 
technology was "servlets" -- server-side plugin Java programs that 
produce dynamic content usually using HTML. Many servlets, particularly 
early ones, were mostly "print" statements, which printed out HTML and 
substituted dynamic information where appropriate. Microsoft's ASP 
(Active Server Pages technology turned that idea on its head. An ASP is 
an HTML page containing special markup that embeds pieces of scripts. 
Though a good idea, ASPs were Microsoft-specific so Sun created 
JavaServer Pages to compete with ASPs in the cross-platform arena, 
providing freedom of choice to systems designers.

A JavaServer Page (or, simply "JSP page") combines HTML tags with HTML-
tag-like markup to produce HTML (or XML) when run on a server. For 
example, a JSP page containing code like this:

    <TABLE><TR>
    <% for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) { %>
    <TD><%= i %></TD>
    <% } %>
    </TD></TABLE>

..will produce HTML that looks like this:

    <TABLE><TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>2</TD>
    <TD>3</TD>
    <TD>4</TD>
    </TR></TABLE>

JSP pages, for all their usefulness, have some problems. First, they're 
very difficult to maintain when they're not written cleanly. Second, 
they're seldom written cleanly; therefore, maintenance is usually an 
issue for JSPs of nontrivial complexity. To make matters worse, you 
might have noticed something about the JSP page fragment above: it's 
not even well-formed markup. Don't bother trying to parse something 
that looks like <%= i %> with an XML parser. It just won't work. The 
XML specification doesn't allow such a string to form an element.

Why is this a problem? Controlling the structure of the document 
contents is one of the benefits of validating marked-up documents using 
DTDs. You can eliminate a whole class of problems with markup (though, 
of course, not all problems) by validating the document with a DTD. 
However, structural safeguards that a validating XML parser could 
provide to a JSP page aren't available to it, because the JSP notation 
shown above can't possibly be well-formed.

Fortunately, the designers of JSP technology have provided an alternate 
XML syntax for JSP pages. Every XML-like, non-well-formed markup 
structure (like the <%= %> structure used for expressions), can also be 
expressed as a well-formed XML tag. JSP's designers also defined a DTD 
for that markup, so you can create well-formed *and* valid JSP pages, 
improve the quality of your documents, and simplify the maintenance 
process.

The code sample above, in JSP XML notation, looks like this:

    <TABLE><TR>
    <jsp:scriptlet>
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    </jsp:scriptlet>
    <TD><jsp:expression>i</jsp:expression></TD>
    <jsp:scriptlet>}</jsp:scriptlet>
    </TD></TABLE>

This JSP page may not be particularly readable, but it *is* a well-
formed XML fragment and it *can* be validated against a DTD. As for the 
readability problem, that's a concern of JSPs in general rather than 
the notation, and can be addressed with other techniques. At least this 
form provides JSP developers with a way to create JSP pages that can be 
validated against a DTD.

Each application's designer that uses JSP technology will need to 
choose between the original JSP notation's pseudo-markup (which is the 
most widely-known, and more concise), and the XML-based alternate 
notation. However, knowing you have the choice is nice when choosing to 
use JSP pages.

COMMUNITY DISCUSSION

XML & Java
XML is starting to take off as a practical way to represent data. Even 
as more Websites (including this one) are employing it, it's also 
finding uses in software modeling and design and other non-publishing 
contexts. How are you using it? What's keeping you from using it? What 
are the best tools? This is the place to share ideas about how to take 
advantage of this emerging technology. Moderated by Mark Johnson.
