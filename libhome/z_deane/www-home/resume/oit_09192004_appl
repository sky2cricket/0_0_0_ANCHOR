Dear Ms. Mathews,

I would like to be considered for the position IT Analyst III posted on the 
Univerisity of Tennessee Staff Employment website.   

I have an MS in computer science (UTK 98), MS in geochemistry (Penn State 73), 
BS in geology (UTK 69), 15 years at TVA as a geologist/systems analyst, and 
currently (the past 4 years) at Marketlnx.com which provides web based 
database access for Real Estate Boards.  

At Marketlinx, the typical client will have 10,000 to 50,000 real estate 
agents who want to turn on their computers and hit the database all at the 
same time.  The database will have 50 to 100 tables, all interrelated.  
The 100+ web pages will have to be user friendly, easy on the eyes, fast to 
load, and be supported by sql queries that won't bring the servers down.  
We have standard pages that provide point and click access.  We have custom
pages that allow the user to fill out a form and build his own custom web 
pages to access the database, for queries, for display, print, and for file 
ftp upload/download.

I work as part of a team of over 30 programmers.  I work in MS Windows 
98/2000/xp/2003 environment.  I use MS Visual Interdev as text editor 
and source control and MS Visual Source Safe as a repository.  My coding
must interface seamlessly with that of others.  I have just completed a set of 
web pages that allow the client to access any row in any of 16 tables by 
entering a key value and clicking the button for the desired table.  The user 
can then update any individual field in that row from the web page.  The other 
tables for the same key value can be visited by clicking on a dropdown menu.  
The user can push a button to insert a new row.

On the code side, I work in client/server javascript and visual basic, html, 
dhtml, css, asp, ado, perl/cgi, and xml.  We have been transitioning to .net
coding, so I have introductory experience with that. 

On the database side I work in MS SQL 7.0 Enterprise Manager and Query 
Analyzer.  To build the web pages I must be able to understand the queries 
I write and get the best possible performance.  I have also written 
databases from scratch in Enterprise Manager.  I have set up export 
packages, import packages, stored procedures, and views.  I have set up
import packages for data from flat files, from MS Access databases, and 
from SQL databases.  I write the packages so that the work can be turned
over to non-programmers. 

I have vast experience in trouble shooting and documenting code.  I have 
written user's manuals and course materials, web-based and in print.  While 
in CS graduate program I helped write the original lab manual and web pages 
for CS 100.  My CS Master's project was a java application to demonstrate how
internet packets are built.  

I believe I can bring many of the skills needed for the IT position in the 
Office of Information Technology.  Although I enjoy my work at Marketlinx, 
your position offers new variety and the opportunity to work in emerging 
technologies.

My resume is attached.  My online code demo can be seen at:

My references are at the end of this email.  My current salary is $43,500 
per annum.  I look forward to  hearing from you.  

Yours truly




Christine Haygood Deane
