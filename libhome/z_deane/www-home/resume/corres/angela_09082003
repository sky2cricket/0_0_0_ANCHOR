I had no idea your files got wiped!  I haven't checked  in in a while -
I wonder if mine are all still there.

Of course you can use me as a reference.  Here's the info:

The wedding sounds wonderful.  You guys will have a blast.  Will you
send me information on where she's registered for gifts?  

Have a great week.  Good luck on the job.  Let me know how it goes...

Hi Angela,

How are you?  How are the girls?  And Dan?

We are in the midst of getting ready for Alice's wedding
Sept 28 -- she is having a full costume renaissance wedding
at the Maryland Renaissance Fair.  

Bill is having a great time with the Geology Dept.  He is taking a
course about planetary climates this semester.

I am doing okay at Marketlinx but have found a job that really interests
me at the School of Information Science at UTK.  I am hoping that I can
use you as a job reference.  And I would need all of your address info.
My address list at cs was 
wiped out when they clobbered all of my files...  It was kind of like
waking up one morning to find out someone had 
amputated your left leg.  

Thanks in advance!

cheers!
cricket!
