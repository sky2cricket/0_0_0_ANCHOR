Dear Ms. Mitchell,

I would like to be considered for the position Research Associate II
posted on the Univerisity of Tennessee Staff Opportunities website.   

I have a master's degree in computer science ( UTK 1998 ) and job 
experience in C, Java, Perl, Javascript (client and server side), 
ADO, Asp, and MS SQL, ESRI Arc View, and ESRI Map Objects.  My 
CS master's project was a JAVA application to demonstrate how 
the different network layers build packets for transmission over
the Internet.  Dr. Beck and Dr. Plank were on my committee.

For the past 3 years I have been with Marketlinx.com, which provides 
web based database access for Multiple Listings Services ( Real 
Estate Boards ).   I have been part of a team writing web pages in a
multi-tier environment.  All of my work for Marketlinx is proprietary 
and not available to anyone outside of Marketlinx.

My resume and demo of code can be seen at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/DEMO.html

My references are at the end of this email.

My current salary is $42,500 per annum.  

I will follow this email with paper copy.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
