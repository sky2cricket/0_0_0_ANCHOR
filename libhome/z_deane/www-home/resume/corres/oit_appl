Dear Ms. Mathews,

I would like to be considered for the position IT Analyst III 
posted on the Univerisity of Tennessee OIT website.   

I have a master's degree in computer science ( UTK 1998 ) and job 
experience in C, Java, Perl, Javascript (client and server side), 
ADO, Asp, and MS SQL, ESRI Arc View, and ESRI Map Objects.  My 
CS master's project was a JAVA applilcation.  

I also have a master's degree in Geochemistry ( Penn State 1973 ) 
and 15 years with TVA as a geologist/systems analyst.  The TVA 
position was a public service position.  Our first priority was 
to promote the economic development of the region. 

For the past 3 years I have been with Marketlinx.com, which provides 
web based database access for Multiple Listings Services ( Real 
Estate Boards ).   I have been part of a team writing web pages in a
multi-tier environment.

One part of my responsibilities has been the tax web pages.  I began 
with just writing the web pages ( input forms to generate sql queries, 
output display of reports ) and then worked my way up to building 
databases from scratch, writing stored procedures for imports and 
updates, and wrote one export package.  All of this work has been
done in MS SQL 7.0 environment.

I realize that this position will be in the Oracle 9iAS environment
which is not the same as MS SQL, but I am happy to learn this new
technology and will take any training/courses that you suggest or
do online training on my own.

All of my work for Marketlinx is proprietary and not available to 
anyone outside of Marketlinx.

While a CS grad student, I helped to develop the course CS100,
an introduction to computers for non-CS majors.  As lead TA for
CS100, I ran labs and supervised all of the other TA's, including
scheduling and evaluations.

My resume and demo of code can be seen at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/DEMO.html

My references are at the end of this email.

My current salary is $42,500 per annum.  

I will follow this email with paper copy.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
