<p>  Work Experience:
<p>  From 1969 to 1983 I worked at the Tennessee Valley Authority
as a geologist and computer systems-analyst.  I made maps, developed databases,
edited a newsletter, wrote Fortran programs, helped with public
information requests, helped with environmental impact statements,
wrote an information handbook about solar power in the TVA Region,
and worked on geological aspects of numerous projects.  
<p>
During my time at TVA, I also took classes at UTK in geology,
geochemistry, geophysics, inorganic chemistry, statistics.  I
 took numerous in-house short courses at TVA on computer operations
 and IBM 360 system programming.  I also
attended a week long work shop in geohydrology and ground water
flow modelling at Princeton in 1980.
<p>
<p>  I retired in 1983 to raise my two daughters.  
<p>  I returned to school in 1995 to pursue a master's degree in
computer science.  I have been a teaching assistant in cs102, cs100, and
cs360.  I wrote the CS100 Guide to How to Make your own Homepage (link
given below) and the CS100 Lab Manual (about 80 pages) and created the
web site for the course. In summer 1996, I was promoted to  "valued TA" 
position to supervise other TA's in CS100.  In spring 1997, I received 
the DuPont award for excellence in Teaching Assistance.  
<p>  In August 1998, I was hired by the Innovative Computing Laboratories,
University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  I have worked on applying the
Java Native Interface to the ATLAS suite of programs and to Legacy Fortran
code.  I am also involved with the Performance Tools Application Implementation 
[PAPI] project.

<p>
I have had courses in or experience with the following computer languages:

<br> I developed the database to manage data collection, helped reduce field
tapes  of magnetic values to computer input, helped reduce field video tapes
of flight path to computer input, supervised coop students in data reduction,
contoured the maps, and coordinated final copy with photoshop.

<p>&nbsp;
<br> This was an immense project that spanned several years.  I developed the
database that made the unification of all this data possible.  I contoured all
the data, helped with reduction of gravity and aeromagnetic data, and rectified
three different coordinate systems (Kentucky Carter Coordinates, standard
USGS latititude and longitude, and Universal Transverse Mercator grid) to
a single norm for publication.  When the lead cartographer died, I took over
his responsibilities to coordinate final copy with photoshop.

"Prospects" a newsletter for the Mineral Resources Community.  For one
year (1978) I wrote articles, solicted articles, edited, and helped prepare final
copy for "Prospects."  The publication came out quarterly and was popular
reading for those who cared about the comings and goings of Mineral 
Resoures in the seven state TVA Region.  Unfortunately, President Carter
invented zero-based budgeting and that took care of my career as a
newsletter editor.
