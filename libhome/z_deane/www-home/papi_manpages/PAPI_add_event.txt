PAPI_add_event          PerfAPI LIBRARY            PAPI_add_event



NAME
     PAPI_add_event - set up a new or modify an existing EventSet

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_add_event (int *EventSet, int Event)

     int *EventSet -- a reference to an EventSetInfo structure

     int Event -- code for an event, such as PAPI_INT_INS

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_add_event () This function sets up a  new  EventSet  or
     modifies an existing one. To create a new EventSet, EventSet
     must be set  to  PAPI_NULL.  Separate  EventSets  containing
     events  that require use of the same hardware may exist, but
     may not be started if a  conflicting  EventSet  is  running.
     Returns  the  error  code  PAPI_ENOEVNT  if  Event cannot be
     counted on this platform.  The  addition  of  a  conflicting
     event   to   an  event  set  will  return  an  error  unless
     PAPI_SET_MPXRES has been set. Note: EventSet 0  may  not  be
     used; it has been reserved for internal use.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call  succeeded  (a  positive  integer  corresponding to the
     index in the EventCodeArray where this event is  stored)  or
     failed (an error code).
