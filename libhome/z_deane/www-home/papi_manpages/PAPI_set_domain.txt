DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_set_domain() This function sets the execution domain in
     which  events  are  counted.  Here domain is one of the con-
     stants   PAPI_DOM_USER,    PAPI_DOM_MIN,    PAPI_DOM_KERNEL,
     PAPI_DOM_OTHER,      PAPI_DOM_ALL,      PAPI_DOM_MAX,     or
     PAPI_DOM_HWSPEC as defined in the header file.   These  con-
     stants  are listed below and can also be found in the online

     cates  whether  the  call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not
     PAPI_OK).
