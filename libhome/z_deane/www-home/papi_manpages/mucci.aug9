Cricket, I really like the web page interface. Can you do a few things?

Can you just make it one panel on the left with the index of functions?
Then there should be just 2 buttons and then a list of functions. You
can reduce the font to get more on screen. 

1 for the PAPI home page
2 for email/sending typos

Great job.
