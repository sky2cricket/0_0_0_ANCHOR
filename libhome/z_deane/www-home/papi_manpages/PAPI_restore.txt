PAPI_restore            PerfAPI LIBRARY              PAPI_restore



NAME
     PAPI_restore -  restore  the  state  of  PAPI  and  hardware
     counters

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_restore (void)

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_restore() PAPI_save and PAPI_restore are for  use  with
     external  libraries  that wish to preserve the state of PAPI
     and the hardware counters. For instance a  C++  instrumenta-
     tion  library  will  probably  want to call PAPI_save() upon
     entry to it's functions and PAPI_restore() upon exit.

     These function calls map to whatever is the  most  efficient
     on the underlying platform for saveing and restoring.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
