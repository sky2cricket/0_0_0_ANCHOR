NAME
     PAPI_start - start counting events contained in an EventSet

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_start (int EventSet) int EventSet  a  reference  to
     an EventSetInfo structure

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_start() starts counting all of the hardware events con-
     tained  in  EventSet.   All  counters  are implicitly set to
     zero.  PAPI_start() will not start the hardware counters  if
     a  conflicting  EventSet is already running and the counters
     are already in use.  starts counting  all  of  the  hardware
     events  contained  in EventSet.  All counters are implicitly
     set to zero.   PAPI_start()  will  not  start  the  hardware
     counters  if  a  conflicting EventSet is already running and
     the counters are already in use.  starts counting all of the
     hardware  events  contained  in  EventSet.  All counters are
     implicitly set to zero.  PAPI_start()  will  not  start  the
     hardware  counters if a conflicting EventSet is already run-
     ning and the counters are already in use.   starts  counting
     all  of  the  hardware  events  contained  in EventSet.  All
     counters are implicitly set to zero.  PAPI_start() will  not
     start  the  hardware  counters  if a conflicting EventSet is
     already running and the counters are already in use.  starts
