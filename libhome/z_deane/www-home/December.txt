C!,
Here is my Dads schedule for December:
.
        Your father asked me to e-mail the schedule for our December visit,
so
here it is.  I'm sorry about the late arrival in Knoxville, but the
earlier flight would have cost us $120 more.  Your dad said he'd rather
take the later flight and save the money.
        We're looking forward to seeing you and hope to see the girls, too.

We haven't seen Alice since she was in high school.
        Let me know if you receive this.
Love,
   Ethel  edeane@home.com
