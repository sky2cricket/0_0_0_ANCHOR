A teacher only succeeds when the student truly understands.  
The challenge for the computer science teacher is to explain complex technologies in a comprehensible manner.  
While the over all needs of the class must be met, the more advanced students must be challenged with the opportunity to learn beyond the boundaries of the course and those who lag behind must be offered both encouragement and additional help.  
Equally important is the need to project a desire to learn into each student by fostering a positive and interesting classroom environment.  
Ideally, the class will be the high point of each student's day.
