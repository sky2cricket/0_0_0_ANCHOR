All of my life I have enjoyed teaching and explaining.  Nothing else I have ever done has brought me more long term satisfaction.  At every job I have ever held, I have instinctively gravitated towards assuming teaching duties and writing training manuals.  The explosion in computer technology that has occurred over the past few decades is just a portent of what the future holds.  Teaching at Pellissippi State will allow me to be part of that future and to affect the long term well-being of our community in a most beneficial manner.
