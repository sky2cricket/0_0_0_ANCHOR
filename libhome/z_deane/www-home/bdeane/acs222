Dear Ms. Brown,

I would like to apply for the Communication and Marketing Specialist position that you have advertized in The Knoxville News-Sentinel.  My resume is included with this fax.

I am an excellant speaker, a published writer, and an accomplished photographer.  I am extremely good at explaining complex subjects in a clear and understandable manner.  I fully understand the power of both the written word a well-chosen photograph.

I enjoy interacting with people and I pride myself on my positive, patient demeanor. 

I have a strong background in science and technology, and I have worked with computers all of my life.  I am one of the few people in this part of the country that has extensive experience dealings with high volume internet site visitaion.  
The www.devguru.com reference site, that I played a major roll in creating, currently enjoys 175 million hits per year.

Like many Americans, cancer has tragically affected my family and far too many friends.  I sincerely understand the pain, suffering, and devastation caused by this scourge.  I would love to join the fight against cancer and I look forward to 
hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,




Bill Deane
