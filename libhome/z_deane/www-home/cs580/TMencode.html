On page 182 of Hopcroft and Ullman, a method for encoding 
Turing Machines is presented.  This method is summarized below.
<p>
<br>Part 0.  Introduction. 
<br>Part 1.  Building a single move-unit binary string.
<br>Part 2.  Using move-unit blocks to build a TM program
<br>Part 3.  How many Turing Machines can there be anyway?
<p>
<math>
Introduction.
<p>
The alphabet of these TMs consists of  { 0, 1, B }.
<br>The integers 0 and 1 are used as numbers. 
<br>The B stands for BLANK, generally the unwritten part of the
input tape to the right of the regular input.  Zeros and ones
can be written over Blanks.  
<br>Other characters are introduced later in the chapter.
<p>
Note that TM input tapes are infinite in ONE DIRECTION ONLY.
<br>The LEFT end of the tape is defined as an end.
<br>The first character read is the left-most character on the tape.
<br>It is BAD to read that first character and move to the LEFT.
<br>The result is a move off the left end of the tape and you
end up in the pits of nowhere.

Part 1.  Building a single move-unit binary string.
<p>
Hopcroft and Ullman present<br>
The generic move function for a TM: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ( q<sub>i</sub>, X<sub>j</sub> ) = 
                ( q<sub>k</sub>, X<sub>l</sub>, D<sub>m</sub> ) 
<p>
In an effort to eliminate the endless confusion caused by the
subscript "l" (letter l, which by normal people is confused with the
number 1), I shall replace the subscript "l" with the subscript "n" 
for the discussion below.
<p>
The generic move function for a TM: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ( q<sub>i</sub>, X<sub>j</sub> ) = 
                ( q<sub>k</sub>, X<sub>n</sub>, D<sub>m</sub> ) 
<br>where:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>q<sub>i</sub> is the current state</td>
<td> i represents the integer subscript</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> X<sub>j</sub> is the input symbol</td>
<td> X<sub>1</sub>=0; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     X<sub>2</sub>=1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     X<sub>3</sub>=B; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>q<sub>k</sub> is the next  state</td>
<td> k represents the integer subscript</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> X<sub>n</sub> is the output symbol</td>
<td> X<sub>1</sub>=0; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     X<sub>2</sub>=1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     X<sub>3</sub>=B; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D<sub>m</sub> is the move of the tape head</td>
<td>m=0 means move to the left ( L )
<br>m=1 means move to the right ( R ) </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
This generic move function may be encoded in binary as shown below.
I will refer to a single instance of a TM move function as a 
"move-unit" in honor of Frank Zappa's daughter Moon Unit, who is
making more money than any of us ever will.  Also, we'll need to
talk about these move-units later on.  This is my term, not
Hopcroft and Ullman's.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> The first element of encoding is "11", two ones.
    This means begin the move-unit.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> The second element is a string of zeros to represent the
     integer subscript i.  For example, if q<sub>i</sub>=q<sub>3</sub>,
     then the string "000" would represent the subscript "3".
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3 </td>
<td> The third element is a "1" to denote the end of the i encoding.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> The fourth element is a string of zeros to represent the 
     integer subscript j.  
     <br>X<sub>1</sub>= 0 ==> "0"
     <br>X<sub>2</sub>= 1 ==> "00"
     <br>X<sub>3</sub>= B ==> "000"
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 5 </td>
<td> The fifth element is a "1" to denote the end of the j encoding.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 6 </td>
<td> The sixth element is a string of zeros to represent the integer
     subscript k in q<sub>k</sub>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 7 </td>
<td> The seventh element is a "1" to denote the end of the k encoding.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 8 </td>
<td> The eighth element is a string of zeros to represent the integer
     subscript n in X<sub>n</sub>.
     <br>X<sub>1</sub>= 0 ==> "0"
     <br>X<sub>2</sub>= 1 ==> "00"
     <br>X<sub>3</sub>= B ==> "000"
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 9 </td>
<td> The ninth element is a "1" to denote the end of the l encoding.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 10 </td>
<td> The tenth element is a string of zeros to represent the integer 
     subscript m in D<sub>m</sub>, 
    <br>where a move to the left is represented by D<sub>1</sub> = L ==> "0",
    <br>and&nbsp; a move to the right is represented by D<sub>2</sub> = R ==> "00".
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 11 </td>
<td> The eleventh element is a "11" to denote the end of the move-unit.
</td>
</tr>

A summary of the encoding is shown below.

<p>
One important side-effect of this encoding scheme is that
a state named "q<sub>0</sub> cannot be represented in this
format and subsequently is not used when you code TMs this
way. 
<p>
A convention favored by Hopcroft and Ullman (among others)
is to use the state q<sub>1</sub> as the start state and
to use the state q<sub>2</sub> as the final state.

Given the single move (delta): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     ( q<sub>4</sub>, 1 ) = (q<sub>5</sub>, 0, R )
<p>
The move-unit binary string is:  1100001001000001010011

     ( q<sub>5</sub>, B ) = (q<sub>6</sub>, 1, L )
<p>
The move-unit binary string is:  1100000100010000001001011

Part 2. Constructing a TM from move-units.
<p>
One  move-unit is in the form "11---mu---11".
<p>
A string of 3 move-units is in the form "11---mu---11---mu---11---mu---11".
<p> 
The "11" denotes end one move and start another.
<p>
The string "111" is used to denote the start and end of an entire TM program.
<p>
For example:
<p>
A Turing Machine with only 3 moves would be "111---mu---11---mu---11---mu---111". 
<p>
The TM with the moves shown below will accept a single 1 and nothing else.
<br>(i.e. you cannot reach state two with any other input.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     ( q<sub>1</sub>,1 ) = ( q<sub>3</sub>, 0, R )
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     ( q<sub>3</sub>,B ) = ( q<sub>2</sub>, 0, R )
<p>
The move-unit binary string for this machine will be:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
111010010001010011000100010010100111

Part 3.  How many Turing Machines are there anyway?
<p>
There are several different ways of viewing the binary encoding of
Turing Machines, but Dr. Langston favors the following:
<p>
ALL UNSIGNED POSITIVE BINARY NUMBERS CORRESPOND TO TURING MACHINES.
This means TMs are countable, because they can be put in one-to-one
correspondence with the set of Natural Numbers.
<p>
Now most of these Binary Number Turing Machines accept nothing 
(accept the empty set) because they lack the correct format. 
<p>
But some of these Binary Number Turing Machines actually have the
correct format and are able to recognize a recursively enumerable language.
<p>
So are the r.e. languages countable?  Yes, because each binary string
Turing Machine can recognize at most one r.e. language, and the set
of Turing Machines is countable.
<p>
Are the set of non-r.e. languages countable?  No.  Because...
<p>
The set of all languages is 2<sup>Sigma*</sup> and is not countable.
<p>
The set of all languages can be partitioned into r.e. and non-r.e. languages.
<p>
<table border=3>
<tr>
<td> not countable </td>
<td> countable </td>
<td> not countable </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Set of ALL Languages </td>
<td> Set of r.e. Languages </td>
<td> Set of non-r.e. Languages </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
An uncountably infinite set minus a countable subset leaves
an uncountably infinite subset.
<p> 
Therefore the non-r.e. languages are not countably infinite.
<p>
Another thing, each of these Binary Encoded Turing Machines 
corresponds to a number in base 10.  Probably the easiest way
to figure what this number would be is to parse the number as
follows:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A VALID TM ENCODING: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
111010010001010011000100010010100111
<p>
First, break the string into chunks of length 4 starting from right to left.
If the leftmost chunk has 3 or less digits, make it length 4
by padding with additional leftmost zeros.  This padding is 
not needed in this example.
<p>
Second, convert each chunk into its hexadecimal equivalent.
This process is shown below.
<p>

<table border=l> 
<tr>
<td> 1110 </td>
<td> 1001 </td>
<td> 0001 </td>
<td> 0100 </td>
<td> 1100 </td>
<td> 0100 </td>
<td> 0100 </td>
<td> 1010 </td>
<td> 0111 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> e </td>
<td> 9 </td>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> c </td>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> a </td>
<td> 7 </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This process will give the hexadecimal number:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e 914c 44a7
<br> which is easily converted to decimal.
<p>
Well, sort of easily.  Like I need to get my calculator now...
