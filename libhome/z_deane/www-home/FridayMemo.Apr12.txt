QUOTE OF THE WEEK:

Subject: 1943 Guide to Hiring Women

The following is an excerpt from the July 1943 
issue of Transportation Magazine. This was written 
for male supervisors of women in the work force during 
World War II - a mere 56 years ago! Obviously,the
intent was not to be funny, but by today's standards, 
this is hilarious!

Eleven Tips on Getting More Efficiency Out of Women
Employees:

There's no longer any question whether transit companies
should hire women for jobs formerly held by men. The 
draft and manpower shortage has settled that point. The 
important things now are to select the most efficient women
available and how to use them to the best advantage.

Here are eleven helpful tips on the subject from Western
Properties:

1. Pick young married women. They usually have more
of a sense of responsibility than their unmarried sisters,
they're less likely to be flirtatious, they need the work 
or they wouldn't be doing it, they still have the pep and 
interest to work hard and to deal with the public efficiently.

2. When you have to use older women, try to get ones
who have worked outside the home at some time in their 
lives. Older women who have never contacted the public 
have a hard time adapting themselves and are inclined to 
be cantankerous and fussy. It's always well to impress 
upon older women the importance of friendliness and courtesy.

3. General experience indicates that "husky" girls -
those who are just a little on the heavy side - are more even
tempered and efficient than their underweight sisters.

4. Retain a physician to give each woman you hire a
special physical examination - one covering female conditions.
This step not only protects the property against the 
possibilities of lawsuit, but reveals whether the 
employee-to-be has any female weaknesses which would
make her mentally or physically unfit for the job.

5. Stress at the outset the importance of time the
fact that a minute or two lost here and there makes serious
inroads on schedules. Until this point is gotten across, 
service is likely to be slowed up.

6. Give the female employee a definite day-long
schedule of duties so that they'll keep busy without 
bothering the management for instructions every few 
minutes. Numerous properties say that women make excellent 
workers when they have their jobs cut out for them, but that
they lack initiative in finding work themselves.

7. Whenever possible, let the inside employee change
from one job to another at some time during the day. 
Women are inclined to be less nervous and happier with change.

8. Give every girl an adequate number of rest periods during 
the day. You have to make some allowances for feminine 
psychology.  A girl has more confidence and is more efficient 
if she can keep her hair tidied, apply fresh lipstick and 
wash her hands several times a day.

9. Be tactful when issuing instructions or in making
criticisms. Women are often sensitive; they can't shrug off 
harsh words the way men do. Never ridicule a woman - it 
breaks her spirit and cuts off her efficiency.

10. Be reasonably considerate about using strong
language around women. Even though a girl's husband or 
father may swear religiously, she'll grow to dislike a 
place of business where she hears too much of this.

11. Get enough size variety in operator's uniforms
so that each girl can have a proper fit.  This point can't 
be stressed too much in keeping women happy.
