2. SPECIAL TOPICS COURSES - Spring 2002
CS494/594-Network Flow Programming -David Straight
programming implementation of network flow graph
algorithms--e.g. max flow, min cost flow, shortest 
path, etc--emphasis on parallel implementation.  
www.cs.utk.edu/~straight/netflow.html

CS551-Pattern Analysis -Jens Gregor - Introduction to 
statistical and syntactic methods for describing,
analyzing and classifying numeric and symbolic data.

CS594-Visualization and Adv Computer Graphics -Jian Huang
Content Description: In depth study of the fundamentals and 
advanced topics in data representation, optical model and 
transfer function design for volumetric data sets. Direct 
scalar volume rendering algorithms, including splatting, 
ray-casting, 3D texture mapping and shear-warp, and indirect 
methods via iso-surfacing. Discussion of visualization methods 
for vector and tensor fields, distance fields, multi-resolution 
techniques and other advanced topics such as parallel 
rendering, occlusion acceleration, graphics hardware,
image-based and point-based rendering will be covered 
as well. Free-form surfaces, including Bezier, B-spline and 
NURBs are also included.

5. US citizens are encouraged to apply for approximately 200 
National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowships to be 
awarded in April 2002 in the fields of: Engineering, Biociences,
Computer Science, Chemistry, Architecture, Physics, etc. 
Fellowships include a stipend in addition to tuition and fees. 
Stipends start at $23,000. Completed applications must be 
postmarked by January 16, 2002.See www.asee.org/ndseg for

6. Attention graduate and professional students:  You
are invited to attend a workshop on "The Academic Job
Market:  Marketing Your Teaching and Research Scholarship" 
on Friday, October 26, 3:30 in University Center 221.  
We will discuss the current academic job market in higher 
education, and get tips from former UT graduate students 
now in faculty positions in higher education institutions 
that include research universities, comprehensive univ, private 
liberal arts college, and community colleges. This workshop is 
sponsored by the "Developing Future Faculty as Teacher-Scholars" 
project.  For more information, e-mail mentoring @utk.edu.

7. On Getting Your Objects Oriented: Motivated by requests from  
students, the Center for Advanced Educational Technology intends 
to coordinate a semi-formal self/group study in the basics of 
several Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages this Fall

C++, and Flash Actionscript.

Participation is open to any student, faculty, or staff member 
in any Department.  The official book will be "Teach Yourself 
Java in 21 Days" (Lemay, et al, Sams.net publishing),  2nd 
edition or later.  The proposed class non-credit, self-learning. 
However, students interested in independent study credit should 
contact Mike Guidry Department of Physics & Astronomy 
guidry@utk.edu 865-974-7810. More details may be found on the 
class website: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/oops/

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:

  Oh Baby! 

  I was sitting in the waiting room of the hospital after my wife
  had gone into labor when the nurse walked out and said to a
  man sitting there, "Congratulations sir, you're the new father
  of twins!" The man replied, "How about that! I work for the
  Minnesota Twins baseball team."

  About an hour later, the same nurse entered the waiting room
  and announced that Mrs. Smith had just had triplets. Mr.
  Smith stood up and said, "Well, how do ya like that, I work for
  3M!"

  When the nurse appeared next, she told the third man that his
  wife had given birth to quadruplets. "That's amazing! I work
  for the Four Seasons Hotel!"

  At this point the gentleman sitting next to me let out a little
  strangled gasp and hurriedly got up, obviously distraught.
  When I asked him if he was okay, he explained, "I think I need
  a breath of fresh air." The man continued, "I'm the casting
  director for 101 Dalmatians."
