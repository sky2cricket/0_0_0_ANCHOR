1. JICS WORKSHOPS IN HIGH PERFORMANCE SUPERCOMPUTING:

August 21-23  Getting Supercomputing Power from a Build-It-
Yourself PC Cluster

This workshop will be held at the University of Tennessee, 
Knoxville. Registration information is on-line at URL:
http://www-jics.cs.utk.edu/  or contact JICS staff at 
jics@cs.utk.edu, phone (865) 974-3907.

2.  ATTENTION STUDENTS:  The Registration Office and the Bursar's 
Office have a new web site. Circle Park On-Line. 

http://www.cpo.utk.edu/

You can SET your confirmation of attendance, PAY your charges, 
VIEW your holds, VIEW/PRINT your class schedule, DROP/ADD 
courses, SEARCH for courses and more.  All you need is your 
student ID number and your Personal Security Code, the same 
one you use to register by phone. 

This is the easiest way to handle things.  For all the 
GTA's, GRA's and staff don't forget that even if you 
have waivers for course fees you will probably still owe 
student services fees, technology fees, and other fun fees 
those waivers do not cover.  Also, if you do not SET your 
confirmation of attendence or PAY all your fees by the Fall 
2000 deadline, your schedule WILL be CANCELLED.  That payment 
deadline is August 14th at 4:30 PM for people who register
by August 14th at 4:00 PM.

3.  ATTENTION GRAD STUDENTS - With Kathy leaving - I
have a couple of situations with new Chinese students
that weren't resolved.  I have 3 Chinese girls arriving
on August 7th, but they can't get into UT housing yet.
They need a place to stay for a few days.  They will
also need to be picked up at the airport. 

I also have a group of 4 students arriving on August 9.  David
Guo has kindly volunteered to pick them up at the airport;
however his vehicle isn't large enough to pick up that
many people along with their luggage.  Please contact
me at bodenhei@cs.utk.edu if you can help with these
or similar situations that may arise.  Thanks.

4.  CLAXTON - MOVING DETAILS:  

* The refrigerator downstairs in the TA area has to
be emptied and readied for moving.  If you have any
food, containers, etc.  Please claim them.  We will 
be tossing leftover items in the trash.

* In the TA areas there are several bookshelves.  If you
have papers, etc. spread out on these - you need to claim
it and pack it.  We will be recycling anything unclaimed.
If you have something in a filing cabinet, you need to remove
it and pack it with your belongings.  Some of these will not
be moved with us.

* I have a few more boxes with the promise of 50 more and
then they have to be ordered for us.  We're doing the
best we can to keep up.  All of you looking for yellow
labels yesterday - I have more now.

* In Ayres 6 there is an old television that was left
years ago by a grad student.  I assume it works.  If
you would like it - please help yourself.  It will not
be moving with us.  There is a small microwave on the 
filing cabinet downstairs.  I don't know if it works
or not.  If it's yours, please claim it.

*  Continue to watch the tables outside Ayres for free
items.  We will clear it every few days to make room
for more.  

* Layout of the offices in Claxton -  For student offices
designed for multiple people - as you enter the doorways;
the numbering pattern is a,b,c,d, and so forth with "a"
being the first workstation inside the door on the left.

* The move schedule has recently been revised.  It's more 
compressed now, as our intent is to have everyone functional 
before the start of Fall semester.  Please check the schedule:

5.  We should all take a moment today and realize that today
is National Sysadmin Appreciation Day.  Our staff would
really appreciate any of the gift items suggested
at the website below:

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:

Are you a Salesman?

The applicant for life insurance was finding it difficult to 
fill out the application. 

The salesman asked what the trouble was, and the man said 
that he couldn't answer the question about the cause of death 
of his father.

The salesman wanted to know why. After some embarrassment the 
client explained that his father had been hanged.

The salesman pondered for a moment. "Just write: 'Father was 
taking part in a public function when the platform gave 
way.'"

Word Wonders:

Just Wondering....

If a word is misspelled in the dictionary,
how would we ever know?

Why do we say something is out of whack?
What is a whack?

Why is it called "after dark" when it
really is "after light" ?

Why is phonics not spelled the way it sounds?

If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?

Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?
