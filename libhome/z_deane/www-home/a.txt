I am very happy CHRG has turned out to be such a good thing!!  
Please keep me informed of what you're doing there, etc.  
Good work scouting new business already, too.

I verbally accepted an offer as Solutions Designer with IBM e-business 
in north Atlanta.  When my written offer comes in, I'll give notice here 
and secure an apartment up there.  Meanwhile, my boss and the principal 
engineer here are leaving, too.  Neither one knows where they're going, 
though.  Yet.

I will have to quit teaching at MSC.  

The other thing that has been going on since I arrived in GA is that my 
relationship with Nathan is terrible.  We are not on the same wavelength 
at all.  We've been in counseling for a few weeks now.  My move to Atlanta 
during the week will either rejuvinate or kill our relationship.  This has 
consumed a great deal of my energy and time, as you might imagine.  Very 
few people (my parents, my friend Jennifer) know anything about this, so 
please keep it in the Deane household.

Our animals are doing well.  My parents are visiting this weekend.  
Otherwise, that's all the news.

Hope you have a great day.

Angela
