Hi-
The machines in the library should work.  You would have to write a script (something
we have not covered in 411, and probably won't until the end of the semester--the
second class, 517, is all about scripts).  Here is a sample script I just ran and it
does create the proper file

'---start script
theView = av.GetProject.FindDoc("View1")
theView.ExporttoGeoJPEG(90,"d:\canada.jpg".asFileName)
'---end script

What probably would be easier is to use the ArcView Internet Map Server.  We are
supposed to have it on campus, but I have yet to get a copy.  I will ask the software
procurement people about it again tomorrow.
