Deane,

I noticed on your website you had the following text on your cricket error
message page :

error '8007052e' 
This happened when I tried to write a file to a remote server location. 
The proxy permissions were looking for "local machine" which was not the
case. 
How to fix: ??? 

I'm currently getting the same problem with a website I'm writing when
trying to write a file to a remote server.  After selecting not to allow
synchronised passwords when using the anonomous internet account for the
server (which Microsoft recommended as a solution) I'm still getting this
error.  

Did you ever find a way around this???

Cheers,
Damian Phillips
