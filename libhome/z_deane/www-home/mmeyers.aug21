Hi Cricket:

Please forgive me -- I missed your email in my received list until this 
morning.  Must weed the junk mail better!

It was great to meet you as well (I think I've heard your name mentioned by 
Mo or Xiao-hung).  I've worked with them and Karen Burhenn (off now to 
TVA), and now, hopefully, you.

The property information module is probably the best on the ESRI site in 
the Internet Mapping samples.  There's a good implementation of that at 
http://206.246.204.35/public/property.htm.  Another at: 
http://www.co.greene.oh.us/gismapserver.htm,  Both of these are MapObjects. 
 Nashville Metro has just converted to ArcIMS at: 
http://www.nashville.org/mpc/maps/.   One thing you might consider is 
setting up your evaluation copy of MapObjects IMS and downloading the 
Internet Map Starter applications from ESRI.  These include the parcel 
information module.   I can help you if you decide to do this.

The demonstration modules all use existing shapefiles, so the 
plot-on-the-fly strategy you are considering may not allow some of these 
features.  You might look at the ArcSDE documentation to determine if this 
module has potential. I don't know if you have to manually update ArcSDE 
for SQL Server  changes.  One of the major reasons for the shift to ArcIMS 
was better integration with this tier.  ArcSDE would allow you to query the 
MLS data from the GIS client pages, saving some of the back and forth we 
discussed.  Spendy, though, I think.

What do you think about downloading ArcExplorer for David and letting him 
play with some layers of streets and point data?  I can give you street 
level files for any county in Tennessee.

According to Bruce Ralston, Dr. Shaw is teaching the Avenue programming 
class this fall  -- is that what you're taking?  No IMS stuff until the 
spring.

More later!

Mike

Hi Mike,

It was great to meet you this morning!

David has asked me to put together a demo from the
ESRI site that shows how the gis products can work for
MarketLinx.  Right now I am going through the
Property Information module on the Internet Mapping
Demos page.  It looks pretty good.

If you have any suggestions about things you would like
to see in the demo I make, I would greatly appreciate them.

I feel really lucky to get to work with you on this!

cheers!
cricket!
