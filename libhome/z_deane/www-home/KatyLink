Cricket,

I am sending this link so I can visit the site on your home computer when I 
am down there.  The show has been having a segment on fixing up a home to 
sell quickly.  

See you tomorrow sometime!  Hope to get in 4:00 ish - am being heavily 
lobbied by Mom to stay at a motel in west Knoxville, I won't, so as a 
concession to her we will plan on having dinner with her and John Wednesday 
evening, then head out south to see (and stay) with you guys.  Its hard 
having so many people want to see us!     K
