Thanks for the notification.  I just got back from my California trip and
will be in town until early June.

I'll pass the word about Fall Creek Falls..

You're much more astute in finding the computer covers than I was.  But, I
still cannot see entering the Speleospace cover in the photo category--but
I think I'd catch hell if I gave it a medal in the non-photo
category--since the entire cover was made up of variations of one photo.

I can easily make up some kind of special recognition award similar to the
medal--if you think it's worth of it.  We'll keep in touch.

I'm answering your mail as I read it--  I can keep Speleospace in the
non-photo category--but I'll have to duck the wrath of the 'traditional'
cover artists.  Ain't it fun to be the volunteer non-paid coordinator in
this contest?  Do you want the job?  I'm sure that we'll have a
computer-generated category next year!!  Should we include both photo and
non-photo covers in the same category?

Thanx for the input!  I wish there was a way to have the covers sent to
you two first so you can ferret out the computer-generated ones---but I'll
probably just require the folks who enter to tell me honestly whether it
was computer generated or enhanced and see what happens.  Some of that
computer stuff is so good that it's impossible for an old ex-graphics prof
to tell the difference.

But, you can see what a fantastic cover computer manipulation can make
when you see Speleospace, don't you?  I took one look at it and said
"WOW!!==Here's the Photo Category Medal winner!"  Then I started to look
at it closer and noticed reverse images in areas where there was no
"water" and started wondering.  I e-mailed the grotto--and they readily
admitted that it was all from the same transparency.  

So, the bottom line is that there will definitely be a third category next
year--and I honestly think that I should give a special medal-like award
to Speleospace as a separate entity this year to save face with the
'traditional' non-photo entries.  Do you agree?  Paul says that I can do
whatever I wish in the contest, so I'll do it!

Now, can you live with the "include all covers, B&W as well as color,
Photo as well as non-photo?"  I thought of this, because there are several
combo covers entered this year which include artwork and photos equally on
the page--all computer enhanced.  I donate my cost for the postage and
medal awards to the NSS, and each medal costs me about $16...but I don't
mind doing it for one additional medal.  Could you agree to that?

And, this designation would be made part of the February announcement in
the NEWS for the salon--and I'd make it mandatory for the entrants to
designate which covers were computer-enhanced or generated.  I'd have to
watch my wording, since nearly half (I guess) of all grottos use computers
in some way in the production of their covers in desktop publishing.  One
grotto even told me that their publication is sent to most of the members
electronically for downloading to beat the high cost of printing.

Could you and Bill come to a meeting of the minds and send me a brief
description of what should go into the February salon requirements for
this new category?  You two are probably the most educated computer folks
I've got, so I'd value your input.

I'll see what Mike Hood (the new Pres.) says about all of this once he's
seen the covers.  I'll get back to you.
