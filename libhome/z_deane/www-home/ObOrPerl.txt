Hello, world!

This is Simon Cozens, managing editor of www.perl.com, here to
bring you the week's news and developments both in the Perl world
and on our own site.

* Perl at large.

After last week's disappointment, I have two pieces of good news
about the Perl Journal. Firstly, I've been taking your points of
view to Amber Ankerholz and Edwin Rothrock at CMP, and they've
both been extremely receptive to what you've been saying. However,
they've made one thing clear to me: for TPJ to exist as a separate
journal, it'll need support from advertisers. So if you think you
could help out, get in touch with them.

Secondly, even better news, back issues of TPJ are now online.
Get 'em while they're hot:

    http://www.sysadminmag.com/tpj/issues/

use.perl.org has a lovely little article about the pros and cons
of various XML parsing modules, concluding with the discovery of
XML::Checker::Parser, a simple, validating XML parser. Could be
just the thing for you.

Bioinformatics! For some reason, possibly not entirely unrelated to
Lincoln Stein, Perl and bioinformatics go hand in hand. Perl was
involved in the heavy work on the Human Genome Project, and
bioinformatics is something I'm having to deal with more and more
in my daily Perl work. Why am I telling you this? For two reasons.
First of all, O'Reilly has a new book coming out on "Beginning
Perl For Bioinformatics". Secondly, if that sort of thing's your
cup of tea, be sure not to miss the O'Reilly Bioinformatics
conference that's happening at the end of January - it's closer
than you think! To whet your appetite, we'll be bringing you
bioperl articles in the weeks to come.

And finally, an interesting introductory series of articles about
Perl from Extreme Tech, one of ZDNet's Windows web magazines:

* What's new on perl.com

Chatting to some friends this week, we realised that one of the
things that separates an intermediate Perl programmer from an
expert is the understanding of object-oriented Perl. This is one
of those barriers that you need to break through, and it may
take some time and effort to understand it. I know that personally,
I was completely mystified by object-oriented Perl until I'd worked
through the examples in the Perl Cookbook, after which it became
crystal clear to me. So this week's article is aimed at those less
experienced Perl programmers who are grappling with the concept of
OO Perl; we look at a couple of uses of OO Perl and how it differs
from ordinary procedural code, and hopefully, you'll see that it's
not actually as scary as it might first appear.

Enjoy,

Perl 6 : Not Just For Damians
Most of what we've heard about Perl 6 has come from either Larry
or Damian. But what do average Perl hackers think about the
proposed changes? We asked Piers Cawley for his opinions.

An Introduction to Ruby
Ruby is two parts Perl, one part Python, and one part Smalltalk.
So says Colin Steele, a developer who is smitten with this "diamond
in the rough" of scripting languages.
