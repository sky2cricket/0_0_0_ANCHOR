Bill Deane's pizza crust

1 package yeast

1 & 1/3 cups room temp. water

1 tablespoon sugar

4 cups all purpose flour, sifted

1 teaspoon salt

2 tablespoon oil


Mix the yeast with the room temperature water in
a large bowl.  

Add the sugar to the yeast/water and cover with
a wet cloth or paper towel across the top of the
bowl.  Let this sit in a warm place for at least
an hour.  

The mixture should look gooey and bubbly, if nothing
has happened your yeast is DOA and should start over
with new yeast.

Gradually add the flour, stirring as you go, sprinkle
the salt in between adding flour, a little at a time
so it is well mixed.

Add the oil, mixing it in.

Work this dough with your hands, shaping it into a
ball, pounding it, flattening it, make a new ball, 
punch it down again, 3 or 4 times, then make the last
ball and leave it in the bowl, covering the bowl with
a wet cloth and let it sit for an hour to rise.

Then flatten it into your greased pizza pan and bake 
for 10 minutes at 400 degrees in pre-heated oven.

Then remove from oven, add you pizza sauce, cheeze, and
all the other goodies and bake for 40 more minutes at 
400 degrees.

If you make a 'lite' pizza with just a few ingrediants,
then bake for 30 or minutes at 400 degrees.

Cricket's pot roast

1 large red onion

4 large carrots

4 large potatoes

Any other vegetables you want to add.

1 cup of red wine

1 to 2 lbs of choice beef, fat not trimmed off


First prepare the vegetables.  

The onion should have outer skin removed and
cut into 4 large chunks.  Do not chop into tiny
pieces unless you want onion soup.

The carrots should be lightly peeled and each
carrot cut into 2 pieces ( not length wise, but
just to make the carrots short enough to fit 
into the pot ).

The potatoes should be washed well.  Removing the
skin is your choice.  I like to leave on the skins
due to the vitamin content.  Cut the potatoes into
large chunks.


Other vegetables can be frozen, fresh, or canned.
If canned, drain and rinse to remove salt.

Now that the vegetables are ready......

Place your meat into the cooking pot.  Leave the 
fat on because it gives flavor and substance to the
broth.  You can use a slow cooker or a large dutch
oven or any pot that can go into the oven and has
a cover.  You have to cook this covered.

Add the vegetables.  Add the wine.  Add enough water
to fill the pot.  If the water boils away during cooking,
add more.  You do not want your meat to dry out.

Cook for 4 hours at 350 or 6 hours at 325 degrees. The
way you tell if it is done is to poke the meat and see
if it is soft.

Cherry Cobbler from Mildred Deane

2 cans cherry pie filling ( heated)
2 cups bisquick
1/2 cup milk ( whole milk, not skim)
1/4 cup melted margerine
2 tablespoons sugar ( optional )

Put your cherry pie filling into a deep baking dish.
Heat at 400 for 10 minutes.

Mean while you mix the other ingreidants into a 
bowl, stir vigorously with a fork.  You want a 
lumpy texture, not smooth.  If it seems runny, add
more bisquick.  If too dry, add a teaspoon of milk. 

Take the heated cherry mixture out of the oven,
drop the lumpy dough with a spoon on top until you
have mostly covered the cherries.

Bake for 20  minutes at 400 degrees.  

It is done when the dough is cooked all the way 
through.  This is good with vanilla ice cream.
