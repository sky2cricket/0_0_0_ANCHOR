     FIRST STEP:

     To use PacketBuilder, you must be on a machine
     that can do java.  (If you are, go to SECOND STEP.)

     To find out if you are on a machine that can 
     do java, type:
  
     unix> java -version

     If the answer is yes, you will see

     java version "1.1_Final"

     or
     java version "whatever the version is"

     If the answer is no, you will see something else.
     You will have to rsh to a java enabled machine
     and set environmental commands to display the
     java appletviewer.  For example if you are on
     baby-ruth and rsh to hydra2e you would use
     the 2 commands shown below

          unix> xhost +hydra2e
          unix> setenv DISPLAY baby-ruth:0.0

       
     SECOND STEP:

     Now you are ready to run the appletviewer 
     to display the PacketBuilder software.

     Make sure you are in the correct directory
     to run PacketBuilder!
    
          unix> runPBinit


     Be patient.  This takes a while to load.
     All the instructions about using PacketBuilder
     are in the online Documentation Window.
