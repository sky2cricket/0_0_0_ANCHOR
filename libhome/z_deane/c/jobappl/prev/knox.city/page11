1. Describe (in detail) one of the most significant achievements, accomplishments, or 
   work projects you have completed which required you to exhibit this characteristic.

   My master's project, PacketBuilder, is an interactive teaching tool to introduce 
   students to the concepts of Internet Packets.  I originally wrote this tool in
   Java for internal use in the CS100 class.  As a stand alone Java application, it
   works fine, but it does not work as a Java applet on the web due to security 
   violations with web browsers.

   I wanted to put PacketBuilder on a web page.

   I have accomplished about 50 per cent of this goal to date and will have
   100 per cent completion by June 15, 1999.

2. Describe specifically how you exhibited this characteristic when completing
   the accomplishment, or work project.

   I reviewed all options, including:
	1. Complete rewrite of the program in Java to be browser compliant.
        2. Complete rewrite of the program in Perl-CGI.
        3. Complete rewrite of the program in VBscript.
        4. Complete rewrite of the program in Javascript.

   I chose Javascript because for my application it works on both Netscape
   and Internet Explorer. VBscript does not always work on Netscape, 
   Perl-CGI has security issues, and rewriting the whole thing in Java 
   would be horrendous.  (This is well over 3000 lines of code.) 

   This meant I had to teach myself Javascript, which I had never used before.
   As a side effect, I wrote a one page online introduction to Javascript at:

   http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/ipv6/JAVASCRIPT.html
   

3. Describe the outcome or results of your actions. 

   I plan to have the PacketBuilder tool online by June 15, 1999, at:
   http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/PB/PacketBuilder/

   A rough draft version is currently available at:
   http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/plumbium/may99/P5.html

   And I have a new online resource with JAVASCRIPT.html
