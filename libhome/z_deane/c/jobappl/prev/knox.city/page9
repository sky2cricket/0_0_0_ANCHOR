1. Describe (in detail) one of the most significant achievements, accomplishments, or 
   work projects you have completed which required you to exhibit this characteristic.

   The production of the CS100 Lab Manual required more than just writing the text.
   An automatic typesetting program had to be used to put the simple text files into
   a professional format, with Chapter Headings, Section Headings, indented lists,
   and the like.  I had to look at the different text editors available to the
   Computer Science Department and select one that satisfied:

        1. Spend no money on buying anything new!
	2. Correct output format.
        3. Ease of use.
        4. Worked on all different platforms that might be used
           by the student teaching assistants who were helping 
           me produce the document.  [ We have many different machines
           here, all with different capabilities. ]

2. Describe specifically how you exhibited this characteristic when completing
   the accomplishment, or work project.

   The best choice turned out to be LaTeX, a unix based text editor.
   This is the editor used in most of the Computer Science Department
   course materials because it works everywhere.  Output templates are
   available so I could provide the correct output format.

   One disadvantage of LaTeX is that it is not easy to use.  To get around
   this, I developed an extremely strict format style [no imagination needed!]
   and wrote a short tutorial "How To Use Latex" that shows how to use
   LaTeX for typing in the input for a single chapter of the CS100 Lab Manual.  
   This is at:

3. Describe the outcome or results of your actions. 


   The CS100 Lab Manual has an easy to read professional look.
   All subsequent revisions of the CS100 Lab Manual retain the original format.
