1. Describe (in detail) one of the most significant achievements, accomplishments, or 
   work projects you have completed which required you to exhibit this characteristic.

   One of the most frustrating aspects of creating online materials for public use
   is the different display modes and capabilities of different browsers.  This 
   point came home to me when I visited some friends in Greeneville, Tennessee and 
   attempted to show them my homepage via their AOL connection.  My homepage took 
   35 minutes to download and then it crashed.

   I decided then and there to make my public access pages as accessable as
   possible. 
   

2. Describe specifically how you exhibited this characteristic when completing
   the accomplishment, or work project.

   To view my pages in different formats, I downloaded from the net as many 
   different browsers as I could accomodate on my home computer.  When I ran
   out of space for this, I discarded "latest greatest" versions in favor of
   old "tried and true" versions, to get the simplest common denominator.

   I changed my web content to give faster download.  I changed from a gif
   background file for my homepage to a simple computer generated color
   background.  When possible, I exchanged "HTML frames" for "HTML tables", 
   since not all browsers support frames.


3. Describe the outcome or results of your actions. 

   My friends in Greeneville and everyone else can view my pages!
