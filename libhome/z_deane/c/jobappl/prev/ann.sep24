Cricket,

You behaved in a manner that was rude, ridiculous and unprofessional.  

Where do you think you will find a 30 hour a week job with full time
benefits that pays you as much as you made at your last (full time) job and
offers you the opportunity to develop as a JAVA Programmer?

You weren't misled on the drug testing issue.  I told you it would be a hair
test and did not specify how many hairs would be required.  You are the only
person I've ever met who would forego a paycheck for a few lousy strands of
hair.

I think you should reconsider immediately and swallow your pride.  Groceries
are more important.

Ann

Hi Ann --

I will not be accepting an offer from Anderson News.
The reason is that I just walked out on the drug screen
testing.  I had been told it would be a non-invasive 
single strand of hair, but when I got there the tech
said no they needed enough hair to cover this line on
the test form (the line was at least 5/8 in wide) and
that she would take it from various places so it
would not show.

I do not want this job that bad.  I feel that at the
very least I was mislead on this issue.  And now that
I have thought about this, one strand of hair is too
much.  If they cannot take my word for something, so
be it.

Do not try to fix this.  Get another candidate for the
position.  I do not want this job.  I had thought about
copying this email to Rick Deland, but I have probably
muddied your waters enough.  

If you are totally disgusted with me and want to wash
your hands of me, that is fine too.  I thnak you for
your efforts and I wish you well.

cheers!
cricket!
