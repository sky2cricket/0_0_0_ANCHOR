Hi Ann --

This is about the SAIC job.

I am "tentatively interested".  The drive is over one hour, each way,
from South Knoxville.

Is there any possibility of part time work?

I looked at their web site this evening.  The course I am currently
enrolled in ( Geography 411, Geographic Information Systems ) is 
software that SAIC helped to develop and would probably be a good 
skill for me to pick up for this job [ i.e., they should be happy
I am taking it ].

Aside from the drive, the job looks great.  I was hoping to somehow
leverage my geoscience background with my updated computer skills
somewhere along the way.  You may have found a match.

Best way to contact me tomorrow is via email.  I will be at work,
at class, and my daughter is supposed to be driving in from Phoenix.
If you need to talk on the phone, send me email and I will call
you back.

You may show SAIC my "original" resume (with all the geology stuff).
And tell them about the geography course.

cheers!
cricket!
