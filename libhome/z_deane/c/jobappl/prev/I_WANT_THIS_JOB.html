<h4>
Dear Dr. Metros,
<p>
This letter is in response to the Position Announcement for:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Specialist: Graphical Interface Design.
<p>
This letter includes hard copy that need not be returned:
<p>
	<li> my UTK transcript
 	<li> First 15 pages of the CS100 Lab Manual (which I wrote)
	<li> <a target="second_window" href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/resume.html">my resume (click here for online copy)</a> 
        <li> my references are listed at the end of this letter
<p>
I believe that my combination of education and work experience
makes me the ideal candidate to fill this position.  I will
present samples of my work below.  The best way to read this
letter is online, so that you can access the live links in
the text.  Clicking on any live link will bring up a new 
"second window", leaving this letter visible in the current 
window.  Clicking on any other live link will change the display
in the second window.  
<p>
If online reading is not convenient for you, the URLs   
are provided in the text. 
<p>
This letter is available at:
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/I_WANT_THIS_JOB.html
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>
The first duty on the list involves building graphical user
interfaces for teaching purposes.  My master's project was
PacketBuilder, a Java GUI application.  Unfortunately,
this Java code violates security on browsers and cannot go
online, so I rewrote the code in Javascript, just so I could
include it in this job application.  PacketBuilder is an
interactive teaching tool that I developed from scratch.
It can be used as a toy, as an introduction to internet
packets, or as a reference for upper level students in
network programming.  
<p>
PacketBuilder is available at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/plumbium/may99/PB.html</a>
<p>
The second duty is to design and produce print-based materials.
When I was a teaching assistant for the introductory course CS100,
I designed and wrote the CS100 Lab Manual for Dr. David Straight.
I used LaTex for digital layout and character control.  This manual
was developed over the course of a year, from my notes.  Each semester
it is updated slightly, but the basic manual that I created remains
the same.  I include the title page, table of contents, and one sample
chapter with this letter.  [None of these need to be returned.]  Since
the manual is in use this semester, I cannot put it online.
<p>
The third duty on the list is to "provide user-centered graphic
design..."  I designed many, many, online tools for the CS100 course, 
but the enduring favorite has been:
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a target="second_window" href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~cs100/homepage_guide/AB_guide.html">
The CS100 Guide to How to Make Your Own Home Page!</a>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~cs100/homepage_guide/AB_guide.html
<p>
This guide was written for absolute beginners and every semester that
I was a teaching assistant in CS100, many students came and thanked
me for helping them get started with a homepage.  I broke the guide
into 6 short chapters.  Each chapter delivers a "tangible product"
that the student may add to his homepage.
<p>
Other online teaching resources that I have written are:
<br>

</td></tr></table>
<p>
The fourth duty is to develop course materials and teach workshops
on how to incorporate graphic design and media resources into the
teaching practice.  I believe the online resources presented above
should give you a measure of how well I would perform this duty, even
though I have never specifically done this.
<p>

<p>
My qualifications include:
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<li> Master's degree in Computer Science 
	<li> Developing online and print materials for CS100,
	     a course taught by the Computer Science Department
		 at UTK
	<li> Photo-editing skills: Although I have not used the
	     specific tools mentioned in the announcement,
	     I have used unix-based tools (xv, xpaint) for 
             photo-editing and I have dabbled with Microsoft
             Paintshop.  I see no problem in learning new
	     photo-editing tools.
	<li> Communication skills:  I worked for TVA for 15 years
	     and throughout that time I filled public information
             requests in the areas of geology, groundwater hydrology,
             water quality, and flood control.  I was always able to
             listen to the client and then explain technical aspects
             of the information we gave out. 
	<li> Deadlines:  I read your position announcement, taught myself
	     a new computer language, Javascript, rewrote 3000+ lines of 
             PacketBuilder java code into that new language, created the 
             PacketBuilder online site, produced the Javascript introduction page,
             and got this letter to you on time.  I say I can do deadlines. 
<p>
Aside from being able to do this job, I would like to do this job.
I enjoy writing, I enjoy building websites, and most of all, I enjoy
working with people. 
<p>
I look forward to hearing from you!
