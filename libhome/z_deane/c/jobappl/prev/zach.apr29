Dear Mr. Zacharia,

     I intend to apply for the posted position of Research Associate
at the UTK Transportation center.  My background includes MS in 
Computer Science, MS in Geochemistry, and a BS in Geology.  These 
degrees are spread over a 25 year period during which I took time off
to raise my two daughters.

     I worked for TVA from 1969 to 1983, in the areas of geology, 
water quality, ground water investigation, solar power, computer 
aplications, and newsletter editor, among others.  Throughout this 
time I worked closely with administrators, geologists, civil 
engineers, and the public.

     When I returned to graduate school in Computer Science in 1995,
part of my duties included writing the lab manual for the new course
CS100, Introduction to Computer Concepts.  I also wrote an online guide
to HTML which is used in that course to teach web page development.

     Currently I am employed by the Innovative Computing Laboratories at
the University of Tennessee as a Research Associate.  I have worked in
areas of code optimization and hardware counters.  

     My resume is online at:
     
     http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/resume.html

     
     I will send a formal written application to your office shortly.

     I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
312 Hermitage Road
Knoxville, Tennessee 37920
