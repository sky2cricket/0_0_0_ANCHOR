I have not sent them anything, so I'll wait to
hear back from you.  If you like, John told me to
feel free to send them potential candidates, so
you could certainly e-mail them without an "intro"
from me.  Since I've only interviewed with them a
couple of times, I have no big influence down
there.  I just was going to send a note so he knew
I'd referred someone.

Good luck,
Carol
