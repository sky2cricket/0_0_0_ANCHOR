Christine,
You are on a "short" list of people for whom we have requested references, though I will tell you that our selection committee did not feel that any of the candidates we received fully fit the needs of the job.  Yes, we can use some assistance in addition to the advertised position, and that might also be an opportunity for you to interact with us enough to show you can do what we need in that position.  
I'd like to talk with you about your interests and availability.  I'll be out all of Monday, but am around most of the rest of the week -- is there a time you could stop by to talk?
Robb
