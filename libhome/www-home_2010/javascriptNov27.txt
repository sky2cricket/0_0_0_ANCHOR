Backtick Saves the Day
By David Wall

Last time, we saw that you can use the JavaScript language on the 
server-side by enclosing references to server-side objects in SERVER 
tags. That works well when you want to write whole swathes of HTML that 
result from calculations and lookups that are done on the back end, but 
not so well when you need to enclose a little bit of server-derived 
information inside a hard-coded HTML passage.

Let's say we want a particular cell in a table to be one color if the 
page is being displayed in a late-model browser (version 4 or later), 
and another color if it's being displayed in an older browser. We can 
react to the browser type by inspecting the agent property of the 
request object. A request object comes into being on the server-side 
every time the server receives a request for a page, and is destroyed 
when the page is sent out in response to the request. 

This is NOT legal:

<TD BGCOLOR= <SERVER> request.agent.indexOf("4")==-
1 ? "000000" : "CCCCCC" </SERVER> >

You just can't enclose a pair of SERVER tags inside a hard-coded HTML 
tag. The trick is to use the reverse apostrophe character, or backtick 
(`), instead. Use a single backtick in place of the <SERVER> tag, and 
another in place of the </SERVER> tag, like this:

<TD BGCOLOR= `request.agent.indexOf("4")==-1 ? "000000" : "CCCCCC" `>

That does the job.
