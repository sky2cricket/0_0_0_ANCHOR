<h4> PerfAPI PerfometerApplet </h4>
<hr>
<h4>
All code for this page written by C. H. Deane for Phil Mucci as
part of the PerfAPI project.
<hr>
The PerfometerApplet is shown at the bottom of this page.
<p>
Input data for the Perfometer were generated by running PerfAPI counter
for PAPI_FP_INS on a set of loops ( using a small c program named writeCts.c ) 
with a timing interval of 1000 ms.
<p>
The underlying platform was a linux machine with 200MHz chip. 
<p>
These results were stored in array form inside the program
PerfometerApplet.java, for secure use by the applet.
<p>
You can dynamically generate your own Perfometer results by:
<br>&nbsp;
<br> 1. Installing PerfAPI on your system.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a target="windowP"  href="http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/api/">Click here for PerfAPI home.</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br> 2. Using a program similar to writeCts.c to generate counts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a target="windowA"  href="writeCts.c">Click here for writeCts.c code.</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br> 3. Using the program Perfometer.java to make the dynamic display.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a target="windowB" href="Perfometer.java">Click here for Perfometer.java code.</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br> 4. The applet code is different from the frame code.

To the right is a snapshot of the java application display.
<br> The first number [209000] is time in milliseconds.
<br> The second number[6797884] is raw counts on PAPI_FP_INS for
the 1000 ms timing interval at 209000.
<br> The bars in the histogram should reflect the latest count value, with the newest value coming in on the right.
<br> Scaling is based on 2*highest_count_value.
