<b> PacketBuilder by Cricket Haygood Deane</b>
<hr>
I wrote PacketBuilder in 1998 in Java as the project for my MS in 
Computer Science  at UTK.
<p>
I rewrote PacketBuilder in 1999 in Javascript so that I could display
it on the web.
<p>
This is a Graphical User Interface to provide an introduction to how
TCP/IP packets are built.  There is also an option for building 
UDP/IP packets and much documentation about the "rules" governing these
packets and the Internet.
<p>
PacketBuilder takes up a great deal of page space.  Depending on your
browser and the size of your screen, you may wish to generate a new
window.
