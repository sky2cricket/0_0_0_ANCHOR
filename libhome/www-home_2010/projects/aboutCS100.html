<b> CS100 Homepage Guide by Cricket Haygood Deane</b>
<br><b>and course management scripts in AWK</b>
<hr>
The Homepage Guide is a tutuorial for HTML written in 1996 which is still being
used in the course CS100 taught in the CS Department at UTK.
Over 2000 people have learned to use  HTML from this tutorial
while enrolled in CS100.  I have received comments from many other
folks not in CS100 who have also used this tutorial.
<p>
The Guide is part of a full course development package.  I developed
a suite of online pages for the course, and wrote a lab manual  that
provided print interface for web-based materials.	
<p>
The AWK scripts included software to generate class attendance sheets,
grading sheets, and web pages from standard UTK electronic classroll
data.  Most of this software is still in use. The code generator 
presented below creates a web page that links to student CS100 homepages
for a particular section.
