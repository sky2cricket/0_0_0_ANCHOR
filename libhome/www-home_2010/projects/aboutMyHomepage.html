<b> About My Homepage by Cricket Haygood Deane</b>
<hr>
Last fall someone doing statistics on Internet Traffic reported
to me that my homepage is one of the most heavily visited sites
in the CS Department at UTK.  
<p>
It's not because of the artwork!
<p>
It may be the tutorials or the links or the fact that the CS100
lab manual still sends students to my page.
<p>
I have gone for a fairly minimal look, just to make the download
faster.  You can find links to many of my other projects and tutorials there.
I also have a little embedded javascript to send a greeting that 
varies with the time of day.
