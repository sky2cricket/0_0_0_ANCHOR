To Whom It May Concern:

I have had the pleasure of working with Ashley Martin at    
the Community Health Research Institute at the University
of Tennessee.  I am the web master.  She is a research
assistant who is also filling in at the front desk.

Ms. Martin a very hard-working person, quick to learn new skills,
always focused on the task at hand, and unflagginly cheerful,
even when faced with deadline pressures and a heavy workload.

I have been involved in teaching people computer skills since
1995. Ms. Martin has picked up the technology as fast as anyone
I have ever seen.  She has not only learned the technology quickly, 
but has also put it to use immediately.  I think this ability
to learn quickly is very important in a world where computer 
software changes by the minute.

Ms. Martin is also plain old-fashioned nice.  I have been in
the workforce since 1965 and greatly appreciate anyone who
is courteous, pleasant, and kind.  Ms. Martin is all three
of these.

Ms. Martin will be an asset to any office where she works.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
