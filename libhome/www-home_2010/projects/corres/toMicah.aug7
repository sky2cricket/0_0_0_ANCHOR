Hi Micah,

This note is in response to your "invitation to apply"
ad in the Sunday Knoxville News Sentinel.

I am interested in working on I2-DSI and other network
related projects.

My resume is at:  
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/resume.html

My online portfolio is at:
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/projects/

Whether or not you are interested in the skills I can  
offer, I am glad to see this project is still alive
and growing.

cheers!
cricket!
