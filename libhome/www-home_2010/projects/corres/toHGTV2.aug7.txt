Dear Sirs,     

This is in response to your ad for an Application Programmer
in the Knoxville News Sentinel.

I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at UTK in 
August 1998.  I have skills in c, c++, perl, perl-cgi, javascript, 
java, HTML, Unix Shell scripting, and other programming languages.  
I have worked on UNIX, Linux, Windows95/98/NT platforms including 
cross platform development. 

I am currently the webmaster for the Community Health Research Group
at the University of Tennessee.  This site provides online access to
a variety of State public health databases, through html links and
cgi interactive query forms.  My responsibilities include integrating
the work of SAS programmers, geographers, and research assistants
to keep the site up and running.  I also write programs (perl, c, and 
javascript) and unix shell scripts in support of this site.  This is 
an interesting and satisfying job, but a temporary appointment with no 
benefits, which is why I am contacting you.  My current employer does 
not know that I am job hunting and I would prefer that you not 
contact her.  

My resume, enclosed here, may also be seen online at:

Online samples of my work may be seen at:

The website for my current job is at:

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,




Christine Haygood Deane
