PAPI_save               PerfAPI LIBRARY                 PAPI_save



NAME
     PAPI_save - save the state of PAPI and hardware counters

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_save (void)

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_save() PAPI_save and  PAPI_restore  are  for  use  with
     external  libraries  that wish to preserve the state of PAPI
     and the hardware counters. For instance a  C++  instrumenta-
     tion  library  will  probably  want to call PAPI_save() upon
     entry to it's functions and PAPI_restore() upon exit.

     These function calls map to whatever is the  most  efficient
     on the underlying platform for saving and restoring.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
