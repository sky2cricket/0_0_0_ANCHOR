PAPI_describe_event     PerfAPI LIBRARY       PAPI_describe_event



NAME
     PAPI_describe_event - identify an Event by name or number

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_describe_event (char *name,  int  *EventCode,  char
     *description)

     char *name -- the name of the Event in question

     int *EventCode -- the numeric value of the Event in question

     char *description -- a description of the Event in question

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_describe_event () This function identifies a PAPI_Event
     in one of two ways.

     Given the name of the Event (i.e. "PAPI_INT_INS"), the func-
     tion  will  write  the corresponding value in EventCode (51)
     and a descriptive string  ("Integer  Instructions")  to  the
     description buffer.

     Given the integer value of EventCode (51), the function will
     write  the string value of the EventName ("PAPI_INT_INS") to
     the name buffer and a descriptive string ("Integer  Instruc-
     tions") to the description buffer.

     Set *description to NULL if the description is not needed.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
