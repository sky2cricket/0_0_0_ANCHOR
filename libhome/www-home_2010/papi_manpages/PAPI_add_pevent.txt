PAPI_add_pevent         PerfAPI LIBRARY           PAPI_add_pevent



NAME
     PAPI_add_pevent - create an EventSet for a native event

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_add_pevent (int *EventSet, int code, void *inout)

     int *EventSet -- a reference to an EventSetInfo structure

     int code -- a substrate specific identifier

     void *inout -- a substrate specific opaque data structure

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_add_pevent() allocates a new EventSet for a native pro-
     grammable  Event.  Such  EventSets  can  only consist of one
     event, namely that which is specified  in  this  call.   Its
     semantics  are  very similar to that of ioctl() system call.
     inout points to an opaque data structure that is specific to
     the  value  in code.  Higher level macros may be provided in
     the header file.  Please check the  documentation  for  each
     substrate.  This function has a C binding only.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
