PAPI_start_counters     PerfAPI LIBRARY       PAPI_start_counters



NAME
     PAPI_start_counters - get number of hardware counters avail-
     able

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_start_counters (int *events, int array_len)

     int *events --  an  array  of  codes  for  events,  such  as
     PAPI_INT_INS

     int array_len -- the number of items in the *events array

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_start_counters() Start counting the events named in the
     events  array.   This function implicitly stops and initial-
     izes any counters running as a result of a previous call  to
     PAPI_start_coutners().   It  is the user's responsibility to
     choose events that can be counted simultaneously by  reading
     the vendor's documentation.  The lenght of this array should
     be no longer than PAPI_MAX_EVENTS.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
