PAPI_add_events         PerfAPI LIBRARY           PAPI_add_events



NAME
     PAPI_add_events -  set  up  a  new  or  modify  an  existing
     EventSet

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_add_events (int *EventSet, int *Events, int number)

     int *EventSet -- a reference to an EventSetInfo structure

     int *Events --  an  array  of  codes  for  events,  such  as
     PAPI_INT_INS

     int number -- how many items in Events array

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_add_events () This function sets up a new  EventSet  or
     modifies  an  existing  one.   To  create  a  new  EventSet,
     EventSet must be set to PAPI_NULL. The Events  contained  in
     *Events will be loaded into the EventSet. Separate EventSets
     containing events that require use of the same hardware  may
     exist,  but  may not be started if a conflicting EventSet is
     running. If one or more of the items  in  Events  cannot  be
     counted  on  this  platform, this funciton returns the error
     code PAPI_ENOEVNT.  In addition, the invalid entries in  the
     Events  array  are  set to PAPI_NULL, such that the user can
     successfully reissue the call.  The addition of a  conflict-
     ing  event  to  an  event  set  will  return an error unless
     PAPI_SET_MPXRES has been set. Note: EventSet 0  may  not  be
     used; it has been reserved for internal use.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call  succeeded  (a  positive  integer  corresponding to the
     index in the EventCodeArray where this event is  stored)  or
     failed (an error code).
