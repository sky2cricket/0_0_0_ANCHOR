PAPI_overflow           PerfAPI LIBRARY             PAPI_overflow



NAME
     PAPI_overflow  -  start  counting  events  contained  in  an
     EventSet

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_overflow (int EventSet, int EventCode,  int  thres-
     hold, int flags, void *handler)

     int EventSet -- a reference to an EventSetInfo structure

     int EventCode -- integer value for a PAPI Event

     int    threshold    --    threshold     value     in     the
     EventSetOverflowInfo_t structure

     int flags  --  flags  value  in  the  EventSetOverflowInfo_t
     structure

     void *handler -- handler value in the EventSetOverflowInfo_t
     structure


DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_overflow() sets up an EventSet such  that  when  it  is
     PAPI_start()'ed,  it  begins  to  register  overflows.  This
     EventSet may only have multiple events in it, but only 1 can
     be  an  overflow  trigger. Subsequent calls to PAPI_overflow
     replace earlier calls. To turn off overflow, set the handler
     to NULL.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
