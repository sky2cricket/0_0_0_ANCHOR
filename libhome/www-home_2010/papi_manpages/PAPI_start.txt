NAME
     PAPI_start - start counting events contained in an EventSet

SYNOPSIS
     int PAPI_start (int EventSet)

     int EventSet  a reference to an EventSetInfo structure

DESCRIPTION
     PAPI_start()  This  function  starts  counting  all  of  the
     hardware  events  contained  in  EventSet.  All counters are
     implicitly set to zero.  PAPI_start()  will  not  start  the
     hardware  counters if a conflicting EventSet is already run-
     ning and the counters are already in use.

     The return value is an integer that  indicates  whether  the
     call succeeded (PAPI_OK) or failed (not PAPI_OK).
