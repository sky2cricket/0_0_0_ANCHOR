When Existing Methods Aren't Enough
By David Wall

JavaScript exists, essentially, for manipulating a Document Object 
Model (DOM). DOMs are so great, so blindingly *excellent*, that the 
JavaScript powers have come up with several different DOMs for us to 
work with in various environments. But dickering over DOMs is not the 
point of this column. Instead, let's talk about the prototype property 
that's part of most JavaScript objects. It allows us to extend objects, 
adding additional properties and methods to them, as we require. This 
helps make our code more compact and easier to read.

Let's say we have a function that returns true when an array sent to it 
contains at least one element that's not evenly divisible by zero. We 
want to make this a supplementary method -- the containsOdd() method -- 
of the standard Array object. Here is the function:

    function containsOdd() { 
      for (var i = 1; i < this.length; i++) {
         if ((this[i] % 2) != 0) return true;
      }
      return false;
    }

The only thing unusual about that function is that it obviously 
operates on an Array object, but there's no parameter specified in the 
parenthesis on the first line. A parameter is not required because it 
employs the keyword. You'll see how that works in a second.

To attach that function to Array as a method, we have to invoke the 
prototype property. Essentially, prototype means "the object as it is," 
and implies that we can stick additional methods and properties to the 
existing definition. The syntax for doing that is as follows:

    Array.prototype.containsOdd = containsOdd;

Now, assuming that oddArray is an array that contains at least one odd 
element, this code...

    flag = oddArray.containsOdd();

    ...will leave flag set to true.
