A teacher only succeeds when the student truly understands.  The challenge for 
<br>
the computer science teacher is to explain complex technologies in a 
<br>
comprehensible manner.  While the overall needs of the class must be met, the 
<br>
more advanced students must be challenged with the opportunity to learn beyond 
<br>
the boundaries of the course and those who lag behind must be offered both 
<br>
encouragement and additional help.  Equally important is the need to project
<br>
a desire to learn into each student by fostering a positive and interesting 
<br>
classroom environment.  Ideally, the class will be the high point of each 
<br>
student's day.
