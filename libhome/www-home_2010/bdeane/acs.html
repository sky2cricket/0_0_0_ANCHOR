Dear Ms. Brown,

I would like to apply for the Communication and Marketing Specialist 
position that you have advertized in The Knoxville News-Sentinel.  
My resume is included with this fax.

I am an excellant speaker, a published author, a published 
photographer, and a prize-winning collaborater (sp?) of multi-media 
presentations.  I have also worked in film-making, been featured as 
a speaker on the Heartland Series, interviewed on Good-Morning America,
and was the main author for an Internet tutorial site which 
recieves 1.2 million hits a month.

I am extremely good at explaining complex subjects in a clear manner
to folks with little technical background.  I spent 3 years at the
University of Tennessee teaching CS100, a course designed to introduce
students of all ages to computers.  

I worked as a retinal agiogram photographer for 12 years before returning
to graduate work at UT.  I interacted with patients and their families
every day, including explaining procedures to them and reassuring them
about the process of taking a photograph of the retina.

I enjoy interacting with people and I pride myself on my positive, 
patient demeanor. 

I have a strong background in science and technology, and I have worked 
with computers all of my life.  I am one of the few people in this part 
of the country that has extensive experience dealings with high volume 
internet site visitaion.  The www.devguru.com reference site, that I played 
a major roll in creating, enjoys 175 million hits per year.

Like many Americans, cancer has adversely affected my family and far too 
many friends.  I sincerely understand the pain, suffering, and devastation 
caused by this scourge.  I would love to join the fight against cancer and 
I look forward to hearing from you.
