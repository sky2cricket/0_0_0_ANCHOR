All of my life I have enjoyed teaching and explaining.  Nothing else I have ever
<br>
done has brought me more long term satisfaction.  At every job I have ever held,
<br>
I have instinctively gravitated towards assuming teaching duties and writing 
<br>
training manuals.  The explosion in computer technology that has occurred over 
<br>
the past few decades is just a portent of what the future holds.  Teaching at 
<br>
Pellissippi State will allow me to be part of that future and to affect the long
<br>
term well-being of our community in a most beneficial manner.
