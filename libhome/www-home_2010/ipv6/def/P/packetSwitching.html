packet switching
<p>
A method of transmitting messages through a 
communications network, in which long messages are 
subdivided into short packets.  Each packet is
passed from source to destination through 
intermediate nodes.  At each node, the entire
message is received, stored briefly, and then passed
on to the next node.
