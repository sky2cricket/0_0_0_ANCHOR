Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
<p>
The CERT was formed by ARPA in November 1988 in response to the
needs exhibited during the Internet worm incident.  The CERT
charter is to work with the Internet community to facilitate its
response to computer security events involving Internet hosts, to
take proactive steps to raise the community's awareness of
computer security issues, and to conduct research targeted at
improving the security of existing systems.  CERT products and
services include 24-hour technical assistance for responding to
computer security incidents, product vulnerability assistance, 
technical documents, and tutorials.  In addition, the team 
maintains a number of mailing lists (including one for CERT 
Advisories), and provides an anonymous FTP server at "cert.org",
where security-related documents and tools are archived.  The CERT
may be reached by email at "cert@cert.org" and by telephone at
+1-412-268-7090 (24-hour hotline).  See also: Advanced Research
Projects Agency, worm.
