OSI Reference Model
<p>
A seven-layer structure designed to describe computer network 
architectures and teh way that data passes through them.  This
model was developed by the ISO in 1978 to clearly define the
interfaces in multivendor networks, and to provide users of those
networks with conceptual guidelines in the construction of such
networks.  See also International Organization for Standardization.
(From RFC1983.)
