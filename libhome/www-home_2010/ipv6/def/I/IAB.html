Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
<p>
The IAB has been many things over the years.  Originally the
      Internet Activities Board, it was responsible for the development
      of the protocols which make up the Internet.  It later changed its
      name and charter to become the group most responsible for the
      architecture of the Internet, leaving the protocol details to the
      IESG.  In June of 1992, it was chartered as a component of the
      Internet Society; this is the charter it holds today.  The IAB is
      responsible for approving nominations to the IESG, architectural
      oversight for Internet Standard Protocols, IETF standards process
      oversight and appeals, IANA and RFC activities, and liaison to
      peer standards groups (e.g., ISO).  See also: Internet Engineering
      Task Force, Internet Research Task Force, Internet Engineering
      Steering Group, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, Request for
      Comments.
