Hey Alice.  i hope your school-life is not too bad.  i have a state tournament
this coming saturday.  i went to basketball practice monday.  we worked out a bit.
on wednesday i finally get to go to the u.t. gym.  i want to tone up my bod and 
build muscle, any exercise suggestions?  mom seems to be interested in my mtn. bike
idea.  i think i am going to have trouble with the cost.  i mean she did just send you
a big wad of cash. so if i can't get one right away i'll understand that my cool sister
is using the money to complete her "college experience". i asked mom about coming back
up and she said she was thinking about it. i talked to ricardo sunday.  he told me that
i should try to come back up if i could.  i told him about charles phone sex remark.
needless to say, he was not shocked.  ricardo starts MIT on aug.22 or 23 or ?
well i miss you a whole lot, but i will survive.  AS LONG AS I KNOW HOW TO LOVE I KNOW
I WILL GET BY.  oh yeah, U2 released "Last Night On Earth" for the radio down here.
Love You --------------------- S :-).
