National Science Foundation (NSF)
<p>
A U.S. Government agency whose purpose is to promote the
advancement of science.  NSF funds science researchers, sceintific
projects, and infrastructure to improve the quality of scientific
research.  The NSFNET, funded by NSF, was once an essential part
of academic and research communications.  It was a highspeed,
hierarchical "network of networks."  At the highest level, it had
a backbone network of nodes, interconnected with T3 (45Mbps)
facilities which spanned the continental United States.  Attached
to that were mid-level networks, and attached to the mid-levels 
were campus and local networks.  See also: backbone network, mid-level
network.
(From RFC1983.)
