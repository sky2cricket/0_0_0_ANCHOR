acronym
<p>
The creation of a new word (usually a noun) by taking
the initials of a phrase or some letters from a phrase to mean the
same thing as the phrase.  For example:  IETF is the acronym
for Internet Engineering Task Force.

 This is the mother of all acronym pages.  Unfortuately, DOD uses whatever letters it
wants and has no respect for other people's acronyms!  For example, IO, which has 
been used by the computer community for "input output" for over 30 years is defined
by DOD as standing for "information objectives, intelligence oversight, and
international organizations.  Another example, OSI stands for Operational subsystem
interface. But if you are trying to decode some government
document (such as a grant application!!!), this site might give you some clues as
to the meaning of the alphabet soup.
