Access Control List (ACL)
<p>
Most network security systems operate by allowing selective use of
services.  An Access Control List is the usual means by which
access to, and denial of, services is controlled.  It is simply a
list of the services available, each with a list of the hosts
permitted to use the service.
(From RFC1983.)
