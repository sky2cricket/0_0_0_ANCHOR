mbone
<p>
The Multicast Backbone is based on IP multicasting using class-D
addresses.  The mbond concept was adopted at the March 1992 IETF
in San Diego, during which it was used to audiocast to 40 people
throughout the world.  At the following meeting, in Cambridge, the
name mbone was adopted.  Since then the audiocast has become full
two-way audio/video conferencing using two video channels, four 
audio channels, and involving hundreds of remote users.  See
also:multicast, Internet Engineering Task Force.
(From RFC1983.)
