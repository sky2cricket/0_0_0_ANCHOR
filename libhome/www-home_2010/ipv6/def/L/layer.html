<p>
Communications networks for computers may be organized as a set of
mor or less independent protocols, each in a different layer
(also called level).  The lowest layer governs direct host-to-host
communication between the hardware at different hosts; the highest
consists of user applications.  Each layer builds on the layer 
beneath it.  For each layer, programs at different hosts use
protocols appropriate to the layer to communicate with each other.
TCP/IP has five layers of protocols; OSI has seven.  The
advanages of different layers of protocols is that the methods of
passing information from one layer to another are specified 
clearly as part of the protocol suite, and changes within a 
protocol layer are prevented from affecting the other layers.
This greatly simplifies the task of designing and maintaining
communication programs.  See also: Open System Interconnection,
TCP/IP Protocol Suite.
