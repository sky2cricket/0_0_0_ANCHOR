Lycos  
<p>
Lycos, Inc. is a new venture formed in late June 1995 to develop
and market the Lycos technology originally developed under the
direction of Dr. Michael ("Fuzzy") Mauldin at Carnegie Mellon
University.  The part of Lycos you see when you do a search is the 
search engine.  "Lycos" comes from Lycosidae, a cosmopolitan 
family of relatively large active ground spiders (Wolf spiders)
that catch their prey by pursuit, rather than in a web.
