Request For Comments (RFC)
<p>
The document series, begun in 1969, which describes the Internet
suite of protocols and related experiments.  Not all (in fact very
few) RFCs describe Interned standards, but all Internet standards 
are written up as RFCs.  The RFC series of documents is unusual in
that the proposed protocols are forwarded by the Internet research
and development community, action on their own behalf, as opposed to
the formally reviewed and standardized protocols that are
promoted by organizations such as CCITT and ANSI.  See also: BCP,
FYI, STD.
(From RFC1983.)

Note:  An RFC is only issued once.  Any new revisions to the
document will be issued with a new RFC number.  RFC numbers
always increase, so a smaller number means an older RFC, a
larger number means a more recent RFC.  (deane)
