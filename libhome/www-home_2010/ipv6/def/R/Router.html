router
<p>
A device which forwards traffic between networks.  The forwarding
decision is based on network layer information and routing tables,
often constructed by routing protocols.  See also:  bridge,
gateway, Exterior Gateway Protocol, Interior Gateway Protocol.
(From RFC1983.) 
<hr>
<p>
A router is a node that is connected to more than one IP network.
It contains decision making software that chooses the most  
appropriate "next path" for each packet.  The decision is based
upon the address in the IP header of the packet and sometimes upon
traffic flow in the networks.
