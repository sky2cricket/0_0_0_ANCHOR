 This summary of BGP information derives mainly
from <a href="http://www.globecom.net/(nobg,sv)/ietf/rfc/rfc1771.shtml">
RFC1771</a> (the definition of BGP-4) and from other
RFC documents noted in the text.  Other references 
are noted where they are used and in the References
Section at the end.  I built the tables
from RFC1771 information except for the CIDR table
that was adapted from Dr. Halabi's book. 
The illustration of the BGP finite automata also
comes from <a href="http://www.cisco.com/cpress/home/home.htm">
"Internet Routing Architectures by Bassam Halabi.</a>
<hr>
In the original specification for 
Border Gateway Protocol (June, 1989) the authors state:
<p>
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system
   routing protocol.  It is built on experience gained with EGP... 
<p>
This was a nice way of saying that EGP (Exterior Gateway
Protocol) had run out of gas.  EGP had worked well, but no one
could have predicted (or planned for) the explosive growth of the 
Internet.  The original BGP specification was quickly followed 
by others.  We are now at BGP-4.  These revisions are not due 
to any deficiency in the design of BGP, but rather are a
 reflection of how BGP can grow and evolve to accomodate the
 rapidly changing needs of the Internet.

The main problems that drove the creation of BGP in 1989 were:
<p>
<li> Exhaustion of Class B address space. This problem mandated
 the CIDR approach to routing.  Martin talked about CIDR
last week. (Click here for <a href="cidrtable.html">CIDR
Translation Table.</a>) 
<li> Ultimate exhaustion of address space in general.  This one of the reasons to migrate to IPv6.  EGP is not
set up to handle the explosion of addresses that will occur when IPv6 really takes off.
<li> Enormity of Routing Tables. It is now estimated that the full Internet Routing Information Base contains over 21,000 entries.  There is no mechanism to collapse this
information in EGP.
<li> The desire of the business community to have more
control over routing, to treat Internet routes as commodoties for sale to the highest bidder.

     several methods for changing the path to a particular

     host during route authentication.  If the host is found,
     the address is advertised.  If the host is not found, the
     address is discarded from the advertisement list. </td>

     for a certain length of time.  Penalties increase with continued
     flapping.  This feature is supported by policy rather than by

BGP Speakers:
<p>
Any host that uses BGP routing protocol is called a "BGP speaker".
On page 4 of RFC1771, it is stated that "The hosts executing the Border Gateway Protocol need not be routers."
I have found no other mention in the RFCs of "non-router" BGP speakers.
<p>
There are 2 kinds of BGP speakers.
<p>
<li> NON-TRANSIT.  Also called stub and multi-home.
These speakers serve their own AS and provide connection to
the outside world via one (stub) or more than one (multi-home)
route.  Non-transit routers do not carry packets unless the
source or destination address lies inside their own personal
AS.
<li> TRANSIT.  These speakers serve any packet that comes through.
<p>
When a BGP Speaker is in full operation, the other BGP Speakers
with which it communicates are called its BGP peers. (Some peers
are more equal than other peers.  See the discussion of Route
Reflection further down in this document.)
<p>
<hr><hr>
BGP Initialization:
<p>
A BGP Speaker always starts in the IDLE state.  There are 
several steps before the BGP Speaker is ready to accept
packets, including:
<li> making a TCP connection with at least one peer.  Port #179
     is reserved for BGP connections
<li> loading the routing tables (a routing table is here called 
an RIB, for Routing Information Base)
<li> setting all the timers (up to 5 timers)
<li> entering the Established State
<p>
<hr>
The figure below shows the Finite Automata that describes
initialization of a BGP Speaker.

by Bassam Halabi, CISCO Press, 1997.

BGP Timers:
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=3>
<tr>
<td> Timer </td>
<td> Definition </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Initial Timer </td>
<td> Set when IDLE state changes to CONNECT state. This
     timer determines interval between attempting
     initializations.
 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> ConnectRetry </td>
<td> Set when TCP message sent to peer.  If TCP connect fails,
     ConnectRetry timer reset and the host enters ACTIVE state
     and begins listening for connect request from peer. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Hold Timer </td>
<td> The Hold Timer initially set at a large value (like 4 minutes) when BGP
     Speaker enters OPENSENT state.  One Hold Timer is set for each peer-to-peer
     connection and this value must be negotiated.  This negotiation occurs
     by means of OPEN and KeepAlive Messages that take the BGP speaker from
     OPENSENT state to OPENCONFIRM state to ESTABLISHED state. 
     If the Hold Timer is set to ZERO, it means that no KeepAlive messages
     will be exchanged peer-to-peer.  
     Otherwise, the value of the Hold Timer determines how often KeepAlive 
     messages will be sent between peers. A BGP speaker may have different
     Hold Timer values for different peers. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> KeepAlive </td>
<td> The reset value for the KeepAlive timer is set with the Hold Timer.
     A value of ZERO means that KeepAlive messages will not be sent.  If
     the Hold Timer has a value greater than zero, the KeepAlive timer will
     be reset each time an UPDATE message is sent or recieved or each time
     the KeepAlive timer expires.  The purpose of the KeepAlive timer is to
     refresh the connections between  peers, absent any other traffic.
     </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> MinRoute Advertisement Interval </td>
<td> This timer blocks an UPDATE message from being sent out too often.  This limit
     does not apply to IBGP (Internal BGP) messages, since fast convergence of
     RIB's (Routing Information Bases) for all BGP Speakers in same AS is
     a good thing.</td>
</tr>

<td> MinAS Origination Interval </td>
<td> This timer blocks an UPDATE message from being sent out too often.  This limit
     applies to IBGP (Internal BGP) messages.

BGP Routes:
<p>
Routes are advertised between a pair of BGP Speakers in  UPDATE messages.
The UPDATE messages contain
<li> Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
<li> Path and Path Attribute Information
<p>
Routes are stored in Routing Information Bases (RIBs).  Each BGP Speaker
maintains 3 RIBs.
