Dear Professor Guidry,

I would like to be considered for the position IT Analyst III
posted on the Univerisity of Tennessee Staff Opportunities website.   

I have a master's degree in computer science ( UTK 1998 ) and job 
experience in C, Java, Perl, Javascript (client and server side), 
ADO, Asp, CSS, MS SQL, ESRI Arc View, and ESRI Map Objects.  My 
CS master's project was a JAVA application to demonstrate how 
the different network layers build packets for transmission over
the Internet. 

I also have a master's degree in geochemistry ( Penn State 1973 )
and 15 years of experience as a geologist/systems analyst with TVA.
I was co-author on the first computer generated maps in the state
of Tennessee and provided programming support for all aspects of
geology, geophysics, geochemistry, hydrology, and geological 
engineering in the Mineral Resources Group at TVA.

For the past 3 years I have been with Marketlinx.com, which provides 
web based database access for Multiple Listings Services ( Real 
Estate Boards ).   I have been part of a team writing web pages in a
multi-tier environment.  One of my current assignments is to create a
user friendly interface for updating multiple database tables from a
set of web pages.  I have also designed MS SQL databases from scratch, 
written stored procedures for data updates, import, and export.  
All of my work for Marketlinx is proprietary and not available to 
anyone outside of Marketlinx.

Although I do not have direct experience in using Flash or other
animation software, I do  have experience in providing web page
support for college level courses.  While a TA in computer science,
I helped write the Lab Manual for CS100 under the direction of
Dr. David Straight.  I also wrote and maintained the web pages for
this course.  My main reason for applying for the position with you
is that I would very much like to get back into the business of 
creating educational software.  Learning how to use Flash and video 
tools will be a bonus for me.

My resume and demo of code can be seen at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/DEMO.html

My references are at the end of this email.

My current salary is $42,500 per annum.  

My one restriction is that I am seeking full time long term
employment.  I do not job hop and would hope that I could 
dedicate myself to this position.

I will follow this email with paper copy.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
