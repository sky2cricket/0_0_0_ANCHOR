I. Introduction
</h3>
<h4>
<p>
The need for remote communications predates computer networks,
telephones, telegraphs, and even the pony express.  One early
example of remote communication is the famous signal "One if by 
land.  Two if by sea." designed by Paul Revere.   The 
signal was carried over roads with power supplied by horses. Paul
Revere also dabbled in fault tolerance.  There were three riders
 on that midnight ride: Paul Revere, William Dawes, and Samuel 
Prescott. Revere and Dawes were arrested by the British before they
reached Lexington, but Prescott made it through.  Some people say
 that Revere only got credit because he had a good press agent
 (the poet Longfellow), but Paul Revere designed a binary coding
  system and it worked.

Remote communications today include radio, telephone, television,
computer networks, and satellite communications, just to name a few. 
The figure above illustrates how fiber optic and ATM networks can
be connected in a manner that is transparent to the user. 
The network above contains both optical and electronic switches.
This paper examines both kinds of switches, in part to compare them
and in part to show how they can work together.

II. Electronic Networks versus Optical Networks
</h3>
<h4>
A. Physical Behavior of Electronic versus Photonic Systems
<p>
If the laws of physics were the only consideration in network design,
optical networks would win hands down.  The speed of electrons through
metal wire is 2 x 10^8.   The speed of photons through fiber optic 
channels is very close to 3 x 10^8, the speed of light. (Unfortunately, 
even light cannot achieve the speed of light unless travelling through
a vacuum.) These speed translates into electronic network throughput
being measured in Mbytes per second and photonic network throughput
being measured in Tbytes per second, an order of magnitude improvement.
<p>
The switching time of the fastest GaAs transistor is
about 20 picoseconds. The switching time for a photonic transistor 
is 1 picosecond or less. The switching power for an electronic component
power for an electronic component is about 1 microWatt, for a photonic
component, the switching power is measured in nanoWatts.  The figure
shown below displays this information in graphic terms.  When I first 
saw this diagram, I was tempted to label electronic components as 
"the past" and photonic components as "the future". Of course the 
situation is not that simple, but no technological breakthrough can 
overcome the basic physical limits of electronic performance.
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="fig12.1ab.gif"></center>
<p>
But there are some advantages  available to electronic networks
that are fairly important.  For a simple analogy to compare buffering
capabilities, take a garden hose.   This hose can carry either water or,
if  it is held perfectly straight, a beam of light.  If a bucket
is placed at the output end of the hose, the water or light
beam will land in the bucket.  The difference between the two is
immediately apparent:  water may be collected in the bucket and 
stored for later use, while the light just goes away. 
<p> 
Thus, an electronic signal is  composed of physical objects (admittedly very
small physical objects), electrons, while a photonic signal is a transient 
wave phenomena that is associated with electromagnetic characteristics.
This is why buffers are easily incorporated into electronic switches and not
used at all in photonic switches. 
<p>

<p>
The above illustration comes from Tannenbaum, page 95.
<p>

A second difference is the frequency range observed in each type of network,
and in this photonics win.
BANDWIDTH:w

The electronic signals in twisted pair operate in the range 10^4 to 5x10^6.
This limits the bandwidth to no more than 5x10^6 frequencies.  Fiber optics
operate in the frequency range 10^14 to 10^15.  This gives a bandwidth of
9x10^14 to work with.  Because of the interactions between certain lightwave
frequencies and the fiber optic cables (specifically adsorption and polarization
behavior), some frequencies are "forbidden".  But even if half of the 
frequencies were lost, there would still be over 10^14 left.  Clearly fiber 
optics offers a much greater bandwidth than twisted pair [6].
<p> 
The articles discussed below reflect these basic physical properties.
Electronic switching research seems to concentrate on queueing strategies
and buffer management.  Photonic switching research focuses on using
the least number of switches possible and using propogation delay to
substitute for non-existent buffers.  In some places the term "buffer"
is used to describe a photonic component.  This is never a buffer, but
merely a hardware strategy to enable continued signal propogation.
 Because these delay lines affect signals in the same way as queues,
buffer management calculatons and strategies may be borrowed from 
electronic circuit theory and applied to photonic networks, but one
must always keep in mind that there is no such thing as a photonic
buffer.
<p>
B. Design and Cost Considerations
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="figcost2.a.gif"></center>
This figure comes from page 70 of Fisher and Bahl [8].
<p>
If money were not an issue, researchers could happily load up on photonic
cross-bar switches and propogate away. Photons are faster than electrons.
Unfortunately the price of each photonic switch is astronomical when 
compared to that of its electronic counterpart.  The figure above shows
costs per square mm for electronic chips.  Cruz and Tsai report that a
single 2x2 photonic cross-bar switch costs $2000.  And this switch needs
an amplifier that costs just as much if you want to really use it.
Why are the costs for optical switches so high?
<p>
Electronic circuits use silicon chips to perform logic functions.  No matter
how simple or complex, these silicon chips contain no moving parts.  This 
makes the silicon chip cheap to manufacture and relatively easy to maintain.
The electronic switch is built from a series of logic elements.  Noise is 
filtered out, signals are demultiplexed into discrete packets, and routing 
decisions are made with no moving parts.  If there is a burst of traffic, 
the packets are simply off-loaded to buffers to wait their turn.
<p>
In a photonic switch, wavelength division demultiplexing  is  achieved
by using the property of diffraction (see Figure 11.11 a diffraction
grating multiplexor) or refraction (see Figure 12.3, a mechanically 
controlled device that rotates until the index of refraction of the 
lightwave matches the index of refraction of the standard). Both of these 
devices are difficult to calibrate, expensive to manufacture, and
easily thrown out of adjustment.  The second device has the added
disadvantage of being slow (switching time measured in milliseconds).

<p>
Figure 12.4 below shows an electro-optic cross-bar switch.  This simple
hybrid switch is cheaper than purely photonic and faster than electronic,
with switch time measured in nano-seconds.  This is the "smart cross-bar"
switch that Cruz et al use in their Cascaded Optical Delay lines.
Disadvantages of this switch include sensitivity to polarization and the
need for power boosting (that pricey amplifier!) because of going 
back and forth between electronic and optical logic.  This switch
is also used by Chlamtac and Suh in research below.  It costs $2000.

<h3> III. Switching in Optical and Electronic Networks
</h3>
<h4>
<center><IMG SRC="figwave.a.gif"></center>
This figure comes from Jeong and Ayanoglu[1].
<p>
Jeong and Ayanoglu test two distinct types of wavelength switching
in their work on optical switches:  Wavelength-Selective (WS) and
Wavelength-Interchange (WI).  Both approaches avoid the 
"buffer problem" altogether by treating the optical part of the
network as a virtural circuit. And in both approaches, they assume 
that the optical network is connected to "users" by electronic
network segments.  The figure above shows both designs.
<p>  In the Wavelength-Selective design, when the
sender signal reaches the junction of optical and electronic, it is
demultiplexed in electronic mode (taking advantage of electronic
buffering) and then each seperated packet is tagged and assigned
a wavelength that it uses for the duration of the optical network.
The advantage is that this is a very fast method because packets
are routed by assigned wavelength through the optical portion of
the system.  Header information is only read only when the packet
is loaded on to the optic network (by electronic switches) and 
when the packed is taken off the optic network (by electronic
switches). The disadvantage is that blocking can occur at one
wavelength even while others are free due to the preassigned
wavelengths.  Blocking is a serious problem in this design,
because blocked packets are lost.
<p> 
In the Wavelength-Interchange method, blocking is avoided
by using a greedy algorithm to reassign wavelengths at each
optical switch.  This greatly reduces blocking and improves
performance.   The optical part of the network is still treated as
a virtual circuit, so packets are routed by wavelength, not
by header information.
<p>
While these methods may seem wasteful  in terms of dedicating a
wavepath for one message, one must remember that in fiber optics
there is an almost unlimited supply of wavelengths to work with.
Also, designer chemistry continues to come up with new materials
that display predetermined optical properties ordered by the client.
In this field, look for new platics for fiber optics in the near 
future.  Optic cabling composed of multiple fibers, each with unique
wavelength characteristics is already available.  This is an industry
where money talks, and more bandwidth means more money[7].
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="figdl1.a.gif"></center>
<p>
This figure comes from Chlamtac and Suh[2].
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="figdl2.gif"></center>
<p>
This figure comes from Chlamtac and Suh[2].
<p>
The above figures show Chlamtac and Suh's  design to create
pseudo-buffering in optical switches by using optical delay
lines.  Each delay line takes one time slot of wave propogation.
If there is one delay line associated with a crossbar switch,
the switch effectively "holds" two packets.  They tried many different
configurations and found that with three switches and a total
of 11 delay lines they were able to practically eliminate packet
loss.  By queueing theory, they were able to show that the
eleven delay lines worked best when broken into 2 sets that were
relatively prime to one another.  
<p> The disadvantage of this method is that once this system is
in place, the signal must traverse all the delay lines whether
there is heavy traffic or not.  The advantage is that the signal
travels so fast that this enforced delay is no problem.  The
main advantage of this approach is cost.  Adding a few feet or a
few hundred feet of fiber optic cable is free compared to the
cost of adding another $2000 switch!
<p> Both of these systems achieved a packet loss rate of less
than a ten percent chance of a single packet lost in 400,000 
time slots.
<p>
<p>
Cruz and Tsai use the same crossbar switch as  Chlamtac and Suh, but
the strategy is to intelligently re-route excess packets through extra
switches during times of heavy traffic.  This is shown in the figures below.  If two packets are in contention
for the same output of the switch, the newer packet is deflected into the
cascaded delay line while the older packet wins the route.  The path that
circulates through the crossbar switches may be thought of as a FIFO queue.  
Two different COD designs were tested, TC and TCC.  For both designs,
a chain of TC (or TCC) modules was used to simulate buffering. The TC 
modules are simpler and cheaper.  The TCC modules were more effective
in preventing packet loss.

This figure comes from Cruz and Tsai[3].
<p>
Cruz and Tsai also incorporate some delay lines in the same way as the
previous authors, but do not show them in the drawings because this is not the
focus of their work.  They report a loss probability rate of less than
one tenth of one percent for one packet at 90% network utilization if 
a chain of 2 or more TCC modules are used.
<p>
An electronic switching system.
<center><IMG SRC="figbuf1.a.gif"></center>
This figure is from Law and Leon-Garcia[4].
<p>
The figure shown above is meant to be a "generic" electronic design.
It is a shared loop control buffering system.
Note how many switches and buffers are used! For this buffer design,
Law and Leon-Garcia achieve a packet loss probability of 10^-6 
under heavy use conditions.  If this circuit appears complicated,
well, it is.  The math and queueing theory that support it are
even more complicated.
<p> In the survey article by Awdeh and Mouftah[4],
a wide variety of  electronic switching architectures are described.
The common trait is the lavish use of components.  There are no simple
streamlined systems, because electronic designers are attempting to
squeeze every last ounce of performance out of their systems.

<h3> IV. Conclusions </h3>
<h4>
The  physical properties inherent in fiber optic networks (greater
bandwidth, higher rate of transmission) will ultimately make fiber
optics the network of choice for most applications.  The main disadvantages
seen today are cost and lack of buffer capability in fiber optic switches.
The cost issue will be  resolved in the marketplace, just as it was
for semiconductor components.  The lack of buffering is on the verge
of being solved, as shown in the articles above.  The revolution in
fiber optics is upon us already.  Anyone interested in computer networks
would be well advised to learn all about fiber optics immediately.
But the mass of electronic networking systems in place mandates the
development of networks that can use the old (electronic) and the
new (photonic) together.
