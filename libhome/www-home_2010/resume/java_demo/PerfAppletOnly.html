<td>
To the right is a snapshot of the display created by  the java application program
<b>Perfometer.java</b>.
<br> The first number [<b>209000</b>] is time in milliseconds.
<br> The second number [<b>6797884</b>] is raw counts on PAPI_FP_INS for the 1000 ms timing interval starting at <b>209000</b>.
<br> The bars in the histogram should reflect the latest count value, with the newest value coming in on the right.
<br> Scaling is based on 2*highest_count_value.
