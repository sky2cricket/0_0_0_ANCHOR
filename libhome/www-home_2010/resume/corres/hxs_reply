Dear Christine,

Thank you for your interest in the position. Unfortunately, I was just
recently informed that funding for the position has been frozen and
therefore I am putting the filling of the position on hold until the
funding is released. 

I will be happy to accept a resume but I do not foresee the position
becoming available before January 2004, if that.

Thank you again for your interest,

Donna Parang

Subject: Question about Research Assoc. position



Dear Dr. Parang,

I am interested in the Research Associate position with
the Department of Health and Exercise Science, but I have
a question that I am sure you will be able to answer.

My background includes over 14 years with TVA as a geologist/ systems
analyst.  I have a masters degree in computer science ( UTK, 1998 ), 3
years of MS Sql 7.0 programming, some experience with simple SAS
queries, and experience in DOS, UNIX, IBM, and windows operating
systems.

I visited the bookstore to see similarities between MS SQL and MySql and
I have confidence I could use MySql at the same level as MS SQL for
queries, data updates, imports, and exports.

However, I am a database programmer, not a database administrator. I
would be happy to take courses in database administration, if needed,
but would not be able to "hit the ground running" in this capacity.

Does this position entail database administration or just database
programming?

I am extremely interested in applying for this position and have spent a
very enjoyable hour visiting the department web pages.

You can see more about me at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/DEMO.html

Please let me know if you think I should apply for this position.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane ( aka Cricket )

Dear Dr. Parang,

Thank you so much for the information!

Because I am currently employed, the timing of the job start
is not do or die for me.  I will definitely send in an application
and resume for you to have on file and spend my time teaching myself
MySql and reviewing SAS.

I think that this position will be really interesting for whoever
eventually fills it.

Thanks so much!

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
