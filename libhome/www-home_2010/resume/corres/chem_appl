Knoxville, TN 37996-1600 

Dear Dr. Dadmun,

I would like to be considered for the position Research Associate II 
posted on the Univerisity of Tennessee Staff Positions website.   

I have a master's degree in computer science ( UTK 1998 ), a master's
in Geochemistry ( Penn State 1973 ), 15 years at TVA as a geologist/
systems analyst. For the past 3 years I have been with Marketlinx.com, 
which provides web based database access for Multiple Listings Services 
( Real Estate Boards ).   

I have many years of communicating scientific principles to the 
public.  Most of my duties at TVA were to fulfill information requests
from the public.  I also developed a newsletter Prospects to promote 
the Minerals Industry in the TVA Region.  While a graduate student in
computer science, I was lead teaching assistant, wrote the lab manual, 
and developed the web pages for the introductory course cs100.

As for interacting with a range of scientists...  While at TVA I was
the liason between the computer programmers and the geologists who 
were trying to work together without learning each other's languages.
I was also one of the author's of the first computer generated map
in the State of Tennessee.

Yours truly,
