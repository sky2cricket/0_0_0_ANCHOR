Dear Dr. Parang,

I am interested in the Research Associate position with
the Department of Health and Exercise Science, but I have
a question that I am sure you will be able to answer.

My background includes over 14 years with TVA as a geologist/
systems analyst.  I have a masters degree in computer science
( UTK, 1998 ), 3 years of MS Sql 7.0 programming, some experience
with simple SAS queries, and experience in DOS, UNIX, IBM, and
windows operating systems.

I visited the bookstore to see similarities between MS SQL and
MySql and I have confidence I could use MySql at the same level
as MS SQL for queries, data updates, imports, and exports.

However, I am a database programmer, not a database administrator.
I would be happy to take courses in database administration, if
needed, but would not be able to "hit the ground running" in this
capacity.

Does this position entail database administration or just database
programming?

I am extremely interested in applying for this position and have
spent a very enjoyable hour visiting the department web pages.

You can see more about me at:

Please let me know if you think I should apply for this position.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane ( aka Cricket )
