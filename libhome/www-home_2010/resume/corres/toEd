Dear Ed,

Bill told me that you have expressed a need to hire a full time programmer in the near future.

I would like to be considered for this position.  I am available immediately. 

I am currently working full time for Marketlinx.com for benefits, 3 weeks leave/year and
a salary of $37,500/year.  I love my job out there, the work is challenging, the people
are really nice, but when they relocated to Farragut, I began spending 2 hours a day 
commuting.  For me, ISSI has a superior location.

I can bring you programming skills in a variety of languages, design skills (both web 
page and database), and documentation skills.  I wrote the Lab Manual for CS100 in
1998, plus all of the web pages associated with the course.  I have also written a 
number of online tutorials (linked from my homepage and from my online resume).  

My resume is at:

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,
Cricket Haygood Deane
