Dear Mr. Lumley,

I would like to be considered for the position Research Associate III 
posted on the Univerisity of Tennessee Staff Employement website.   
I have a master's degree in computer science ( UTK 1998 ) and job 
experience in C, Java, Perl, and SQL.  I also have a master's degree 
in Geochemistry ( Penn State 1973 ) and 15 years with TVA as a 
geologist/systems analyst.

For the past 3 years I have been with Marketlinx.com, which provides 
web based database access for Multiple Listings Services ( Real 
Estate Boards ).   I have been part of a team writing web pages in a
multi-tier environment.

One part of my responsibilities has been the tax web pages.  I began 
with just writing the web pages ( input forms to generate sql queries, 
output display of reports ) and then worked my way up to building 
databases from scratch, writing stored procedures for imports and 
updates, and wrote one export package.  All of this work has been
done in MS SQL 7.0 environment.

I was also involved in developing the Geocode Mapping module for 
Marketlinx.  This is an application in object oriented javascript 
that uses ESRI mapping tools to create (1) small area maps for 
individual properties and (2) large area maps to display all of the 
properties for sale in a given area.  This includes zoom, pan, 
clicking on a house icon in the map to bring up a full text report 
and photograph of the house.  I have taken two courses from UTK 
Geography Department ( introduction to ESRIi ArcView and introduction 
to ESRI map objects ) that helped me better understand the underlying 
code.

All of my work for Marketlinx is proprietary and not available to 
anyone outside of Marketlinx.

I love my current job, but I have visited your web pages and I really 
like the variety of different projects presented.  I see this position 
as an opportunity to become part of a team doing some very exciting 
and challenging work. 

My one drawback is that all of my database experience is in MS SQL 7.0, 
not ORACLE or Sybase.  I would be happy to take training needed for 
these systems.  

My resume and demo of code can be seen at:

http://www.cs.utk.edu/~deane/resume/DEMO.html

My current salary is $42,500 per year.

I will follow this email with paper copy including my references, 
which are not available online.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
