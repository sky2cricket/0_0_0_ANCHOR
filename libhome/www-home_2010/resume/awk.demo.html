<h4>
AWK is a lightweight scripting language,  
excellent for small scripting tasks.  I used
awk to generate html pages, attendance sheets,
and grading sheets for all the sections of
CS100 each semester from standard UTK class rolls.
<p>
In this example,  
the class roll for CS100 section 28707 was used to generate
a homepage for CS100 section 28707 with links to 
webpages for all students enrolled in that section.
At the time of creation, all of those links were active.
Now, of course, those urls no longer exist.
