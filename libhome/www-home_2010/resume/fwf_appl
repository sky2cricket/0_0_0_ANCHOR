Dr. George W. Hopper
274 Plant Scient Building
Knoxville, TN 37996-4563

Dear Dr. Hopper,

I would like to be considered for the position IT Analyst II 
posted on the Univerisity of Tennessee Staff Employment website.   


I have an MS in computer science (UTK 98), an MS in geochemistry 
(Penn State 73), BS in geology (UTK 69), 15 years at TVA as a
geologist/systems analysist, and currently (the past 4 years) at
Marketlnx.com where I (1) build web pages that allow users 
to access databases and (2) build databases that serve web pages.





experience in C, Java, Perl, SAS, Javascript, ADO, Asp, MS SQL 7.0,
ESRI Arc View, and ESRI Map Objects.  In my current job, I work 
in windows 98/2000/2003 with Microsoft Frontpage and Microsoft 
Visual Interdev as editing tools.


For the past 4 years I have been with Marketlinx.com, which provides 
web based database access for Multiple Listings Services ( Real 
Estate Boards ).  I have built databases from scratch on MS SQL 7.0,
including designing tables, writing stored procedures to automate
import, and building a package that included daily updates and
exports.  I am just now finishing a set of web pages to allow a
set of clients to edit and import a daily feed and directly edit 
every field in every table in their database. 


I also have 15 years with TVA as a geologist/systems analyst.  In 
the late-seventies our group ran an aeromagnetic survey of the 
region.  I organized the flight line data into a virtual matrix 
using IBM-JCL to access the tapes in the correct order.  I wrote
Fortran programs to evaluate the data ( i.e. correct for the earth's 
field and then take second and third derivative ) and other programs
to reformat it for the CalComp plotting program.  I wrote a user
interface to the CalComp program because it took a crow bar to
figure out how to input the plotting parameters for each map.
I would call this information managment now.  We did not have a 
name for it then.


I have vast experience in trouble shooting and documenting code.
I have written user's manuals and course materials, web-based and
in print.  This week I have been re-factoring code from another
programmer.  When he wrote it, it was pretty good.  Then the 
database schema changed and the fieldnames broke. 


I believe I have many of the skills you need and you have a number
of things for me to learn ( oracle! ).  I will be happy to take any
courses or training that you suggest.  I spent about an hour at 
your department website this evening and enjoyed it thoroughly.


My resume and demo of code can be seen at:

My references are at the end of this email.

My current salary is $42,500 per annum.  

I will follow this email with paper copy.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours truly,

Christine Haygood Deane
