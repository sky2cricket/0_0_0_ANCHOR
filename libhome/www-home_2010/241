          billbus@gte.net


Hi Folks,

I just read this message from here in Pittsboro. This is all I've read
about this. I'm sure there will be more details to follow. I wanted to
pass this along to Dick's many friends in TAG and elsewhere.

Dick lived for a time in Huntsville, so his TAG roots run very deep.

I'm sure you, like me, already miss him.

Our grief and condolenses go out to his wife Shari, and his daughter
Emily. Let's keep them all in our prayers, as well as those doing the
recovery, in our prayers for next several days.

With Shock and Grief,

Bill Bussey

 From Devin Kouts on the PSC Listserve:

Bill, Bob,

There was a fatality in Omega yesterday (Saturday 9/27). Dick Graham died
after falling down the 200+ drop. Just now got back to Harrisonburg and
found Bill Stone's email (from late yesterday) telling me he was heading
down for the recovery along with Tommy Shifflett and Greg Clemmer. I
assume you must be aware of this by now, but just in case you have not
heard, I'm sending you this. I can't believe we were all oblivious of
this at VAR this morning.

I did not know Dick, but I assume you must know him, and I'm so sorry
about this terrible news. I have no other details as Bill just sent me
a very short message before heading out.

Vonny

2)  Tag Rules
      By: Jeff Lynn  (Vinemont, Alabama)
          bamacaveman@yahoo.com


Hey, fellow cavers. I have been reading all the turmoil over the new and
old rules for the TAG CAVE-IN and think it is getting very funny. All you
guys that are complaining are sounding like a bunch of little kids when
they are given rules at home by there parents. I know for myself I have 3
kids that I make rules for ages 14, 10 and 8 and I hear it all the time,
"that isn't fair" or "why can't I do that" and on and on and on. The
fact is we as a society need rules and regulations because without them
we would only have chaos. I myself have much respect for the DCG for
undertaking this huge event each year and will happily follow all rules
and regulations that they set for the CAVE-IN. Just go have a good time
with good friends!  Later Cavers, Jeff Lynn NSS 38192

3)  Camping fee at pre TAG Fall Cave In
      By: Peter Michaud  (Birmingham, Alabama)
          BHMmudpup@aol.com


I heard this weekend that the price for camping at the Cave In PRIOR
to the event is going to be 12 dollars per person per night.  If I am
wrong, correct me.  That is an outrageous amount for camping in a field.
I will not be coming before Thursday noon for sure this year.  Pup

Re: stupid rules and the tightening of the vice:

Those with nothing better to do than to concern themselves with the
actions of others always invoke the sacred mantra that "those who don't
play by the rules are cheating those who do".

To begin with, it is not "cheating" to refuse to be coerced. Aside from
that, what difference does it make if someone else fails to pay or fails
to play by some petty rules?  Like good christians, we are deeply troubled
that someone somewhere might be having unauthorized fun.

I am more than willing to pay my fair share to support TAG, but it is
utterly inconsequential to me whether or not someone else manages to
sneak in. The percentage of those who might try to sneak in is close to
zilch! But perhaps we need more of these to counter to toxic effects of
the fascist do-gooders. I recommend coming in over the mountain.

A much more serious problem is our acquiescence in the face of armed
thugs demanding protection money in exchange for allowing us to have our
little weekend of fun. Is this Mexico (I wish!) Where paying bribes to
cops is a way of life? How does this differ from the Mafia demanding a
"cut" from any business conducted within their "turf"? The Cave-In pays
big bux to the landowner, we have clout, so why bend over? If we must
pay off the cops, at least pay them to STAY AWAY!

Party crashers and other such terrorists are a new threat that demands
immediate action!

It is nice to remember the warm fuzzy past, but in reality the more things
change the more they stay the same.  In 1968 a carload of FBI agents in
trenchcoats actually came to the Old Timers Reunion to look for me and a
friend of mine. My name was on a list of Un-American troublemakers that
they actually showed to registration. The woman running registration was
the daughter of the US Secretary of the Treasury, so the dumb feds assumed
she was above reproach.  After assuring them that she would report any
suspicious activity they left, then she came to my tent and showed me
their business card. Maybe we should hire the FBI to run security?

John Ashcroft has probably intercepted this message, and the Vicious
Cop Hag is probably waiting for me at the front gate, so I plan to have
a co-conspirator leave a trail of do-nuts as bait to throw them off my
track. Now I suppose I have no choice but to come in over the mountain,

Hello all,

My name is Carey Frost and I live in Smyrna, TN. I am a current member of the 
NSS and the Nashville Grotto. Most of my caving activities have been in Middle 
TN. and the Cumberland Plateau, but as I continue to get more involved with the 
Grotto, I would like to expand outside of the local area into AL. and GA. 
Thanks in advance for accepting me as a new member of TAG net.

Hello All,

It's with much sadness that I am reporting to the TAG community the 
death of Dick Graham. Dick died in Blow Hole Omega Cave, Virginia on
Saturday = after a rappelling accident in the 200 foot pit. The recovery
operation ended at 1115 hours this morning.

Jeff Dilcher just sent me a note want me to post a bit more info to
the list. Here is a short summary. The reports I have are that Dick was
rappelling down the 200 foot drop on a Petzl descender. He was down 
about 40 feet and for some reason which I do not know, the device came
off of the rope and he fell 160 feet.

The recovery operation was started on Saturday with cavers from all over
= the eastern states involved, needing more help on Sunday team members
from Knoxville Cave Rescue, Walker County Cave Rescue and Chattanooga 
Hamilton County Rescue were called in to assist.

Buddy

9)  TAG...........
      By: Keith Minor  (Atlanta, Georgia)
          rkminor1@AOL.COM





            So basically to sum the issue of "rules" and admittance. The
weekend is the same its been for years. The hours of registration are
the same they've been for years. Even the cops are the same THEY'VE been
for years. So what's the problem with arranging your schedule for ONE
weekend?? Hell, everyone gets the SAME 1 year notice.


           Regretfully (sort of), I have planned a mountaineering trek in
Central America that weekend and will be leaving on that saturday morning
of TAG........ First one i have missed in several years. I guess i'll
just suck it up, wipe away the tears and bust my ass up the mountain while
you people are sucking down the beers and whatever else it is you consume.


            PARTY ON FELLOW CAVERS!!!



                                                               Keith

=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 3hoots@earthlink.net


"You may want to consider that some of the "new rules" are there to
protect the adults at the sauna. I grew up with hippie parents taking
me to places like LoveValley, where nudity was everywhere. But that
was in a different time, when spanking your kid was O.K. and lawsuits
were uncommon. As a nurse working in a large pediatric hospital,
my eyes where opened wide to just how many lawsuits concerning child
welfare (both legit and bogus) are filed. A dad may think it is Okey
Dokey to expose his 16 yo son to nudity at TAG, however, his mom, who
isn't present may not have the same views. Pissed off mom could bring
up charges against the Cave-In and all the "nekid" folks at the hot
tub. When this gets to court bearing the charge of indecent exposure,
the judge will say "Adults should have known better, used better
discretion and common sense!" Verdict guilty-- case closed!  =A0 =A0
Consider that some of the other rules which have been put in place,
may be to appease the new landowner. These are my views, not that of the
=3D Cave-In chair or board. I've always disagreed with and questioned
the NO =3D DOGS policy, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the party.
Lighten =3D up everyone and have a great time at the 26th Annual! "


Even more of a reason for DCG to purchase some land of their own to
hold TAG= . This way we would not always  have to appease the new
land owner.  We could also then have our own security team and make
it more of a "caver's event".
 We
could even give the vendor's a better setup area. I hear they are not
very pleased with wavy ground  they have to set up in now. After 26
years, I thin= k TAG is here to stay.

As far as the sauna area goes, I do not think we would have any more
really issues than other  "clothing optional" camps and lodges. If
mommy is not awa= re that daddy might be exposing their child to
something at TAG, then she shoul= d pay more attention to her child's
life.  Parents should be the ones dicussin= g it, not us. Since
it is openly declared that the sauna area is there, I doub= t that
they could get  an "indecent exposure" charge to stick, because it is n
ot indecent. It is a "freedom of expression".  I think everyone should
be entitled to enjoy it.

Since we will have a new liability waiver to sign this year, why not add:

DCG and TAG officials and their agents or assignees, participants of
TAG, an= d Sequoah Caverns owners or employees  will not be liable
for parents failur= e to keep their children out of a clearly posted
"clothing optional" area or said parents have signed a waiver freely
stating that they are knowingly allowing their child to  enter such
an area  for the purpose of freely expre= ssing themselves.

Or something like that.

Just something to think about.

11)  with all due respects.......
      By: Glenn Mills  (Birmingham, AL)
          kvart@earthlink.net


FYI......milum....

...great fictional post......yes, I said fictional because of the 
following discrepencies I found in your most recent post to tagnet:

As along as I have been going to the cave-in (since the early 90's),
NO = ONE is allowed entry on Sat night after registration has closed,
except = for people who have already registered and have their badges.....

....and........

since when did the band start playing BEFORE the fire was lit.......

.....and........

what DIRT ROAD are you talking about? All the roads I know of leading to 
and from registration at Sequoyah are paved....are you sure, in your 
stuper, that is was TAG you were at..........???.....inquiring minds 
want to know.......

......and......

I dont know which group of Birmingham Grotto people you found that night 
in your post, but they have "not" had a fire in the field "in the last 
few years". Maybe you meant to say "in many, many years past".......

.....and, maybe you havent been folllowing the B'ham e-group as closely
= as I thought when you point a finger at the DCG tree huggers (who,
by = the way, burns 60 tons of wood each year at TAG......for your 
enjoyment!). You have obviously missed the recent efforts of Birmingham 
tree huggers like Bobby Dodson, Donna Cobb, Leigh Dudrow, and the newly 
appointed SERA Karst Task Force member, Myrna Attaway to help save the 
caves, streams, critters, artifacts, bones, and National Forests that 
are threatened by developmental expansion and quarries!

kvart off

PS.........I too have fond memories of arriving at TAG in the wee hours 
of the morning. In '92 upon my arrival at my first Cave-in at 3AM on a 
Thurs morn, I met and became friends with Tom Allen and George Cowden 
(God Bless ya brother!). Unfortunately, as with many things in our 
society, the thoughtless abuses of a few have led to the punishment of 
the masses..........carbide bombs and dogs are another good example.

.....and.......last but not least.........

Since you listen to the Braves lose on the radio, you have more in 
common with DCG than you thought!


one more thing and I am through.......in my observation, (in the last 
few years) Birmingham Grotto is as involved in helping with the work 
weekends for the Cave-in and supports the new rules as much as DCG
= is/does! Maybe if you were a member and more involved with the 
Birmingham Grotto and came to the meetings instead of forming opinions 
from inaccurate and uninformed posts to certain internet e-groups and 
digests, you too would have the same observation. Now, let me take this 
opportunity to invite you to our next grotto meeting this comming Thurs 
nite, pay your dues, and help us elect a new grotto president! You may 
e-mail any of our grotto officers for directions and times in case you 
have forgotten how to get there......

I'm through playin' now..........
