Mon, 18 Oct 1999 10:36:20  <br> <br>My unit is looking to hire a talented student to work 10 to 20 hours  <br>a week to help us grow our web operations. The position would be for  <br>the remainder of fall semester with the potential of continuing into  <br>future semesters depending on interest and ability. <br> <br>We're looking for someone with experience in basic web publishing and  <br>comfort in working on self-directed tasks. Client platforms are Mac  <br>with some access to PCs with various softare packages used.  <br>Candidates need to be able to take text files and tabular material  <br>and efficiently convert them into HTML. Prowess in developing web  <br>graphics or at least familiarity with basic Photoshop functions or  <br>other image software is preferred. Ability to do high quality work,  <br>including some editing or altering of words without adding errors, is  <br>a must. <br> <br>We offer flexibility in scheduling work hours and a creative and  <br>interesting work environment. Tasks can be discrete and result into  <br>projects that will look good cited on your resume. <br>Please contact me if you're interested. <br> <br>Margot Emery <br>Publications Editor <br>The Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station <br>423.974.7374 - direct | 423.974.7362 - unit <br>423.974.9433 - fax | http://web.utk.edu/~taescomm/ <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><!-- END OF INSERTED CONTENT -->
