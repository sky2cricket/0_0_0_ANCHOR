Miss Deane,

For some time the CS department has had several new versions of
Java available.  Under the directory tree /usr/local you will find three
different versions of Java: 1.1, 1.2 and 1.2.2 (the most current version).
Included with this is jce1.2, the Java cryptography suite which
is also under /usr/local.  

I have examined your path statement in your .cshrc and see that 
you are pointing to the oldest version of Java available.  This 
previous version is kept for software compatibility reasons.

If you alter the path statement you should be able to point to the most
current version of Java.

There are other specific resources in your .cshrc that relate to the
Java path that will also need to be altered to suit your needs.

Do not forget that the path to the Java executables/libraries that appears
first in your path statement will be the one executed if you do not put in an
explicit path.

On a seperate note, all mail concerning the computer science computer
system and the programs installed thereon should be routed to 
help@cs.utk.edu, not departmental faculty.
