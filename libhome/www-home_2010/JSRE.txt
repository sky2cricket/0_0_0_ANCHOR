Regular Expressions: Extracting ISBNs from Amazon.com URLs
By David Wall

Let's say we have a customer who runs a bookstore. It's a real 
bookstore, with shelves and aisles and sullen teenage attendants. 
Nonetheless, the customer uses the database at Amazon.com as a tool for 
locating details about books he wants to order from his distributor. 
The customer searches for a title on Amazon, manually copies its ISBN 
from the Amazon page that gives details on that book, and pastes it 
into another form (in another browser window) that's submitted to the 
distributor that supplies our customer.

Copying ISBNs out of Amazon.com's detail pages is hard. They appear in 
small print and it's easy to accidentally copy an extra carriage return 
as well as the number. A typical Amazon detail page URL looks like 
this: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558882367. 

A lot of times, there's a bunch of extra information on the right-hand 
side, as well. Notice that in the URL, the only 10-character string 
consisting of the digits 0 through 9, plus the capital letter X, is the 
ISBN. We need to write a function that will grab that 10-character 
string and discard everything else. The customer needs an interface 
that allows him to paste the whole URL into a box and extract only the 
ISBN. JavaScript can do the job.

Here is a function that uses a regular expression (a RegExp object) to 
pick the ISBN from an Amazon.com URL.

    function extractISBN() {

    if (document.assignForm.isbn.value=="") {
        var reISBNCatcher = /[0-9]{9}[0-9X]{1}/;
        var input = document.assignForm.amazonURL.value;
        var output = input.match(reISBNCatcher);
        document.assignForm.isbn.value = output;
        }
}

The first interesting line in that function is the one that sets 
reISBNCatcher equal to /[0-9]{9}[0-9X]{1}/. In other words, the regular 
expression matches strings in which exactly nine characters in the set 
0-9 are followed by exactly one character in the set 0-9 plus X. 

Then, the match() method is used to apply that regular expression to 
the input field in a form, sending the results to the output field.
