To all users:

The telnet, rsh, and rlogin services have a long history of security problems.
Not only do they transmit your password in clear text across the network,
there have also been numerous remotely exploitable hacks related to
these services.

One such intrusion method has recently surfaced (see
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-34.html for more information).
As such, we have decided that the wisest course of action is to disable
these services permanently.  We realize that this will be an inconvenience
to many of our users.  However, the inconvenience caused by
three days of downtime waiting for a machine to be reinstalled is greater.

Even worse, a hacker could potentially destroy all of a user's data.
Although we do make backups every night, restoring data from tape
is not a fast or fault-free process.

Therefore, we have made the difficult decision to disable these
services immediately.  We have put up a set of webpages detailing the 
alternatives that we currently offer.  The pages can be reached 
at http://www.cs.utk.edu/~help/disable. 

Again, we apologize for the difficulties this will cause, 
but we feel that it is a necessary measure to maintain an 
acceptable level of security within the departmental computing 
environment.
