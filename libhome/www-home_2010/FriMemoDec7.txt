QUOTE OF THE WEEK -  Submitted by Scotty Warden

Some thoughts on CHOCOLATE

Chocolate is a Vegetable: Chocolate is derived from cocoa beans. 
Bean = vegetable. Sugar is derived from either sugar CANE or 
sugar BEETS. Both are plants, which places them in the 
vegetable category. Thus, chocolate is a vegetable. To go one 
step further, chocolate candy bars also contain milk, which 
is dairy. So candy bars are a health food.

Chocolate-covered raisins, cherries, orange slices and strawberries 
all count as fruit, so eat as many as you want.

If you've got melted chocolate all over your hands, you're 
eating it too slowly.

The problem: How to get 2 pounds of chocolate home from the 
store in a hot car. The solution: Eat it in the parking lot.

Diet tip: Eat a chocolate bar before each meal. It'll take 
the edge off your appetite, and you'll eat less.

If I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, 
is that a balanced diet?  Don't they actually counteract 
each other?

Chocolate has many preservatives.  Preservatives make you 
look younger.

Put "eat chocolate" at the top of your list of things to 
do today. That way, at least you'll get one thing done.

A nice box of chocolates can provide your total daily intake 
of calories in one place.  Now, isn't that handy?

If not for chocolate, there would be no need for control top 
pantyhose. An entire garment industry would be devastated. 
You can't let that happen, can you?

REMEMBER: "Stressed" spelled backward is "desserts"
