QUOTE OF THE WEEK:

A highly recruited high school football player was visiting several 
SEC colleges.

His first stop was at the University of Florida.

As the recruit was sitting in Coach Spurrier's office, he noticed a 
gold telephone sitting on Spurrier's desk. He said "Coach, what is that 
gold telephone?" Spurrier replied, "That is a direct line to Heaven."

The recruit asked if he could make a call. Spurrier told him he could, 
but the toll would be $20,000 dollars. The recruit said that was more 
than he could afford and he left.

From there, the recruit went to the University of Alabama.

He was in Coach Dubose's office and he noticed that there was also a 
gold telephone sitting on his desk. He said, "Coach, what is that gold 
telephone?" Dubose told him that it was a direct line to Heaven.

The recruit asked how much it would cost to make a call and Dubose told 
him, "$15,000 dollars". The recruit said that was more than he could 
afford and left.

From there, the recruit went to Georgia. He was in Coach Donnan's office 
and, once again he noticed that there was a gold telephone sitting on the 
desk. The recruit said, "Coach, what is that gold telephone?"

Donnan said that it was a direct line to Heaven. The recruit asked how much 
it would cost to make a call and Donnan told him, "$75,000 dollars". The
recruit was astonished at the enormous price that it cost to call Heaven 
and left.

From there the recruit went to the University of Tennessee.

While he was sitting in Coach Fulmer's office, he noticed a gold telephone 
on his desk. He said, "Coach, I bet that gold telephone is a direct line to
Heaven." Coach Fulmer told him he was absolutely right.

The recruit then asked how much it would cost to make a call. Coach Fulmer 
replied, "35 cents." "35 cents! They want $20,000 dollars at the University 
of Florida, $75,000 at Georgia and $15,000 dollars at the University 
of Alabama.! Why is it only 35 cents here at Tennessee?"

Coach Fulmer replied, "Son, it is just a local call from here."
