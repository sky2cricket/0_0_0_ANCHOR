The files in the WB directory are from WB4/ on dlc.lib.utk.edu/~cdeane
which is for the downloads.
 
But this code is being extended to add all of the other elements.

This is from store1/area2/volvoices/chd/WBwhatever
[cdeane@anasazi WB]$ ls ../WBfuture/
page_009_tableOfContents.htm  page_018_part.htm
page_010_targetAudience.htm   page_019_extension.htm
page_011_note.htm             page_links_debug_active.htm
page_013_classification.htm   page_links_debug_future.htm

So WB4 and WBfuture are combined.
