go into directory you're working
grep -c "<subject" | grep ":0"

take out any that have no subjects.
run checkfields >> undated
check the undated file for errors.  If NO DATE, remove those files and send them back for work.
take care of other errors.


do NOT run mods2mrk-- they decided to stuff the subjects all in 653 fields.  
  # this puts aleph sequential records into a datestamped marc record.

instead, run fa2mrk.
