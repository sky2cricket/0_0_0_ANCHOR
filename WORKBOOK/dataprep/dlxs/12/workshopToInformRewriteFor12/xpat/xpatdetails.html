the Operators to Make Sets of Interest</h4>
<p>Using some basic XPAT operators, we can build some very specific searches
   that take advantage of the SGML's markup. Here is an actual example from the
   TextClass implementation. The following query is actually the basis for the
   fabricated region called <b><i>mainauthor </i></b>in most of our text collections. <b>Note</b> that
   this query depends on knowing the structure of the document's markup (in case
   of TextClass documents, the regions here are essentially the same as in the
   TEIHEADER of the TEI.2 DTD.) </p>
<blockquote> <pre><code>>> <span class="unixcommand">((region AUTHOR within (region
TITLESTMT within region FILEDESC)) not within (region SOURCEDESC))</span> 6:
2 matches

513768, ..&lt;AUTHOR&gt; Laveleye, Emile de, 1822-1892. &lt;/AUTHOR&gt;.. </code></pre></blockquote>

<hr width="10%">
<p>Here we construct a query to return a PSet consisting of hits on a user-entered
   search term. We want to display a line containing the immediate context of
   the hit and also a title from an enclosing division: </p>
<p>The query for the user's search is simply: 

<blockquote>
 <pre><code> >> <span class="unixcommand">firstsearch= ("Branivoj " + "Branivoj&lt;")</span> 7
 firstsearch = one match</code></pre> 
</blockquote>

<p>To get a division title for the hit we need to build up regions based on the
   hit: 
<blockquote>
<pre>>> <span class="unixcommand">slicesearch= subset.1.25 *firstsearch</span>
8: slicesearch = one match

>> <span class="unixcommand">mainslicesearch = (region &quot;DLPSTEXTCLASS&quot; incl *slicesearch)</span>
9: mainslicesearch = one match

>> <span class="unixcommand">mainheader = (region &quot;HEADER&quot; within *mainslicesearch)</span>
10 : mainheader = one match</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally to view the content of the region we have constructed we enter: 
<blockquote>
<pre>>> <span class="unixcommand">pr.region.&quot;HEADER&quot; (region *mainheader)</span> </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The default mode, in an interactive XPAT session, is "quietoff". This gives
   the results messages you have seen so far: numbered sets, byte offsets followed

   useful for interacting with XPAT programmatically, is "quieton raw". Nothing
   seems to happen when one enters:</p>

<p>However, entering queries now produces results that are tagged in a way that
   is easily parsable from within a program. First enter an earlier point search: </p>

XPAT queries in Perl</h4>
<p>XPAT's ability to return results with tags allows a program to parse the results
   into pieces. In the DLXS Middleware this is done by a group of DLXS Perl modules.
   These modules have methods to let the CGI program interact with XPAT (an XPAT
   process is forked off by the CGI program and queries can be made of it at
   any time). The main object the code uses is the <b>xpat object</b>. It has
   methods for making queries in different ways and for interacting with the
   forked off XPAT process. </p>
<p>Here is some code (from TextClass.pm) that illustrates how the middleware
   uses a method of the Perl-based XPAT object (created in an earlier part of
   the code).</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>... my $query = qq{(region mainheader incl ( $idnorgn incl &quot;$idno&quot; ) );};
my ( $error, $result) = $xpat-&gt;GetSimpleResultsFromQuery( $query );
if ( $error )
{
     &amp;DlpsUtils::errorBail( qq{Query error in FindXPATContainingIdno: $result} );
}

&amp;DlpsUtils::StripAllRSetCruft( \$result );
$result =~ m,&lt;SSize&gt;(\d+)&lt;/SSize&gt;,;
my $hit = $1;
if ( $hit &gt; 0 )
{
    $returnXpat = $xpat; last;
}
... </code></pre></blockquote>
<p>While some code, such as this, makes a query via a simple method, most
   queries in the middleware are actually made by other means, through other
   objects and their methods. Once data has been prepared according to the DLXS
   Class DTDs, in terms of searching, the middleware can be thought of as an
   engine that simply "runs" the
   data.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Whereas in Release 11a and before,
      if there was any code change that needed to be made by DLXS users, it was
      usually when different display of data was needed ("filtering").
   Now, nearly all &quot;filtering&quot; of data for display is done via <a href="../ui/index.html#XslStylesheets">XLST
   stylesheets</a>. Occasionally, collection-specific searches need to be made
   (based on, for example, idiosyncratic markup). The query building for those
   searches may still need to be subclassed. However, most text type collections,
   if using the admittedly loose <a href="../textclass/tcoutline.html#TextClassDTDOverview">   Text Class DTD</a>, will run through
   the middleware with little if any modification, since most standard searches
   are done via those things that help abstract out many idiosyncracies of mark
   up: <a href="#fabricatedregions">fabricated
   regions</a>, mapped search region names, etc. </em></p>

to fabricated regions</b> </h3>
<p>A fabricated region is a &quot;virtual&quot; region that has been indexed. You can use
   any valid XPAT query to create a result set. Then, with the <span class="unixcommand">{export}</span> command,
   you can have XPAT create a binary index of the points in the result.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? If you, or your program, will be making queries
   often on something that is a bit complex (in terms of the query needed), you
   can have XPAT consult a previously created index rather than have it do the
   complex query, each time it might need it, using the usual <em>idx</em> and
   SGML <em>rgn</em> indexes. </p>
<p> For examples and more discussion of fabricated regions, see: <a href="fabregions.html">Fabricated
      Regions</a>.</p>
<p>Once the fabricated regions are created and indexed, they can be searched
   for and printed just like any other region.</p>

<h4> <a name="viewing"></a>Viewing
Sets</h4>
<p>The <b class="unixcommand">pr</b> command is the heart of viewing sets. In
   an interactive XPAT session, it lets you view the results you've searched
   for. Within the middleware, getting the data back from XPAT is just one step;
   <strong>before Release 12</strong>, it was followed by &quot;filtering&quot; operations, Perl
   substitutions using regular expressions, to remove or change other tags in
   the the content and to change the appearance tof the content; e.g. highlighting
   hits, etc., eventually resulting in HTML. <strong>As of Release
   12</strong>, though there is
   some small amount of manipulation of the XML that is returned from XPAT queries,
   essentially all &quot;filtering&quot; (conversion to HTML) is done via <a href="../ui/index.html#XslStylesheets">XSLT
   stylesheets</a>. </p>
<p>The format the results that XPAT returns with <tt class="unixcommand">pr</tt> or <tt class="unixcommand">save</tt> is
   determined by the current <tt class="unixcommand"><a href="#quietonrawmode"><span class="unixcommand">{quieton}</span></a></tt> setting.
   There is a big difference between the normal user-sitting-at-the-pat-terminal
   interactive mode, and the machine-readable modes. </p>
<dl> <dt> <tt class="unixcommand">pr (point-set)</tt></dt><dd> This prints out
the members of the point-set, starting with the first, according to the current <a href="#sortorder" class="unixcommand">{sortorder}</a> setting.</dd><dt> <tt class="unixcommand">pr.X

sets. The resulting set (which is a point set if at least one of the sets being
combined is a point set), consisting of the start offsets of all the points or
regions in the original sets. If <i>all</i> the sets being combined are region

A is a point or region set, B is a region set, the resulting set is all members
of A that are contained (by the start offset rule as under <span class="unixcommand">incl</span>)
in any B. This also takes the <span class="unixcommand">not</span> operator to
return all A's that are not within any B.</dd><dt> <b><tt>A near B</tt></b></dt><dd> A

stated (with <span class="unixcommand">near.#</span>), or taken from the <tt class="unixcommand">{proximity}</tt> setting).
The <span class="unixcommand">not</span> form returns all A's whose start offsets
are not within the specified number of bytes from the start offset of any B.
The nearest B might be earlier or later in the source file.</dd><dt> <b><tt>A

except that an A must be followed within the specified number of bytes by a B
to be in the result set. This can also takes the <span class="unixcommand">not</span> operator.</dd><dt> <b><tt>not</tt></b></dt><dd> This
reverses the sense of the expression it modifies, usable with <b class="unixcommand">incl</b>, <b class="unixcommand">within</b>, <b class="unixcommand">near</b>,
