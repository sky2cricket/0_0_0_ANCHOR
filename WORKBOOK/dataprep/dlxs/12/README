General Rules:
The idea is to manage the files like any other web space delivered
directory.

1) Everyone writes their own HTML in their own dev spaces.
2) CVS updating and committing will manage changes and provide some logging
   information.
3) When a DLXS release happens, the directory will be CVS
   tagged, staged and sent to dlps8 as well as packaged for the release.
4) Here at DLPS, we can all continue to make changes and commit
   them as we make them. What is updated from CVS into the "release"
   directory (i.e., /l1/web/d/dlxs/docs) will be our internal up to date
   documentation. That which is rdisted to dlps8 (at DLXS version
   release time)  is what the world sees so that it is in synch with
   the latest release.

Finally using Dreamweaver went through files changing filenames to not
use old, redundant "journal doc system" volume/issue dependent names.
Required CVS removing old, and CVS adding new files.
Also changed "last updated" dates to use CVS $Date: 2005/06/15 19:00:00 $ for automatic updating.

Ran script to tranform XML versions of the DLXS documentation that had
been maintained via the journal publication system into HTML
versions. Put them under web/d/dlxs/docs and put that directory under
CVS control.

The idea is to manage the files like any other web or cgi
files. Everyone writes their own HTML in their own dev spaces. CVS
updating and committing will manage changes and provide some logging
information. When a DLXS release happens, the directory will be CVS
tagged, staged and sent to dlps8 as well as packaged for the release.

Here at DLPS, we can all continue to make changes and commit
them. What is updated from CVS into the "release" directory (i.e.,
/l1/web/d/dlxs/docs) will be our internal up to date
documentation. That which is on dlps8 is what the world sees.

Pre 20041006:

Note that web/d/dlxsdocs is under CVS control.  The publication system
is the primary version control mechanism for this tree, NOT CVS.  CVS
is used to facilitate the tagging and packaging of this document tree
for DLXS release processes.  Only at each release time, all changes
should be committed and new files/directories cvs added and cvs committed.
