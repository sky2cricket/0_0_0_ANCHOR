<h1 class="pageTitle">Overview and Contents</h1>
<p> Through a combination of <a href="colldatabases.html">database</a> tables
   and <a href="collmgr.html">collmgr</a> field configuration,
   dynamic browsing is available through the DLXS middleware. When the proper
   CGI-based URL is received, the middleware checks for certain metadata in the
   database tables, packages some of it in XML, uses some of it, as is in its
   stored format of XML, and lets XSLT format the results. At run time, no <a href="../xpat/index.html">XPAT</a>   queries are needed, only MySQL queries are run against the item browse tables
   in the  <a href="colldatabases.html">dlxs
   database</a>. </p>
<p>After the tables are prepared, that is,  populated with item metadata through
   the <span class="command">$DLXSROOT/bin/browse/updatebrowsedb.pl</span> script (aka &quot;database populator&quot;),
   configuration for the behavior of dynamic browsing is accomplished by modifying
   certain <a href="collmgr.html">collmgr</a>   fields.</p>
<p>Provisions will soon be made for creating static HTML browse pages with the
   database populator script. </p>

<h1> <a name="ItemBrowseTables" id="ItemBrowseTables"/>Item browse database tables </h1>
<p>There are three tables in the dlxs database that are specifically used for
   dynamic browsing in the middleware:</p>
<ul>
   <li class="command">ItemColl</li>
   <li class="command">ItemBrowse</li>
   <li class="command">ItemBrowseCounts</li>
</ul>
<p>The ItemColl table holds, for each item/document and collection combination,
   one row containing the following columns: </p>
<ul>
   <li>the idno</li>
   <li>the collection
         id</li>
   <li>the modification date of the row's information</li>
   <li>XML metadata
               about the item: in the case of TextClass, this is simply the <span class="command">DLXSTEXTCLASS/HEADER</span>      element that is retrieved from an XPAT query in the &quot;database
         populator&quot; script. In the case of ImageClass, the Perl subclass used
      by the database populator grabs information from the MySQL or XPAT data
      and wraps it in specific XML before filling in this field. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ItemBrowse table holds, for each item/document's browseable field (e.g.,
   author, title, etc.): </p>
<ul>
   <li>the idno</li>
   <li>the field name</li>
   <li>the value of the field </li>
   <li>rank (not currently used) </li>
</ul>
<p>The ItemBrowseCounts table holds, for each collection, a list of rows containing:</p>
<ul>
   <li>	colleciton id</li>
   <li>the field name </li>
   <li>the first character or the first two characters of the sortable
            field's value (sortable title, author's name) </li>
   <li>the count of items that begin with that first character or those first
      two characters </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="CollmgrFields" id="CollmgrFields"/>Collmgr fields for configuration </h2>
<p>The main fields in the collmgr that need to be set properly are:</p>
<ul>
   <li>locale</li>
   <li>browsenav</li>
   <li>browsefields</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="#Configure">Configure the collmgr fields</a> below for
   more information.</p>
<h1><a name="Preparation"></a>Preparing collections for browsing </h1><h2><a name="Configure" id="Configure"/>Configure
the collmgr fields </h2>
<p>Start collmgr and change the following fields:</p>
<ul>
   <li><span class="command">devhost</span>: if you are running the database populator in a development environment
      (that is, where <span class="command"><a href="../program/devenvironment.html#workdirs">DLPS_DEV</a></span> environment variable
      is set), you can have the middleware use  XPAT-indexed data that is
      on a  machine different from the usual host. This can be useful for testing
      purposes. </li>
   <li><span class="command">locale</span>: (this should be changed to a UTF-8 type of encoding, e.g., <span class="command">en_US.UTF-8</span>)</li>
   <li><span class="command">browsenav</span>: enter 0, 1, or 2. If you want no paging, that is, that all
      items in the colleciton appear on one HTML page for the user to browse,
      enter 0. Enter 1, if you want &quot;one level of browsing&quot;, that is, that a
      separate page be created for each first character of the value in question
      (e.g., title or author) and that a navigation bar be built that allows
      the user to navigate to each page, for example, jump to the page listing
      items whose value begins with &quot;M&quot;. Entering 2 in this field will create
      a &quot;two-level browse&quot;, where two navigation bars will be created. The first
      bar will allow the user to jump to items whose values begin with a particular
      first character (e.g., jump to the records that begin with &quot;B&quot;). The second
      navigation bar will allow the user to jump to items whose values begin
      with a particular two-character combination, (e.g., records that begin
      with &quot;Bu&quot;). This decision is left to the collection coordinator. We have
      found that the level is based on how many total items there are in
      the collection and therefore what is a reasonable number of browseable
      items for a single HTML page. </li>
   <li> <span class="command">browsefields</span>: list the browseable fields for the collection. For example,
      some collections may have only title browsing, others may need both title
      and author, etc. </li>
</ul>
<h2> <a name="PopulatingTables" id="PopulatingTables"/>Populating the item browse
tables </h2>
<p>To initially populate or to update the item browse tables, simply run the
   database populator. To do so, enter:</p>
<p class="command">$DLXSROOT/bin/browse/updatebrowsedb.pl class=AAA c=BBB host=CCC</p>
<p>where <span class="command">AAA</span> is either &quot;text&quot; or &quot;image&quot; and
   where <span class="command">BBB</span> is the collection id of
   the collection you want to create browsing for and <span class="command">CCC</span> is
   the name of the host on which resides the XPAT index for the collection. You
   may want to point the script at new or test data on a machine that is different
   from your production machine. If that is the case, you may also want to change
   the devhost field for the collection in collmgr and test the collection in
   development mode (with the <a href="../program/devenvironment.html#workdirs">DLPS_DEV</a> environment variable set). </p>
<p>Running this program will populate or update the rows necessary in each of
   the three ItemBrowse related tables. These tables will be queried when the
user requests browsing from the middleware.</p>
