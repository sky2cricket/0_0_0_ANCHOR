Glad you told me about diglib2, my email is full of error messages from scripts that can't get there to log into checkscripts database.    I also can't get there to look at this file and see if there's something else in this directory that triggers my memory.  My guess is that there was a FIRST which no longer needs to be done because of changes that one of us implemented since I wrote the darn thing.

the #18 - cd to idx/WW and run make all (wordwheel) for each collection line means:
cd /d1/dlxs/idx/v/vvo/WW    
make all
cd /d1/dlxs/idx/v/vvt/WW
make all
cd /d1/dlxs/idx/v/vvb/WW
make all


Thanks also for telling me about the endeca thing - I didn't know!  I'll be there.

Hi Jody,
 
I was originally planning to go to the Volunteer Voices meeting with Melanie, Bridger, Shantry, and Marielle on Monday, but the Endeca demo is also on Monday and that is more important.  
 
So we can go over my WTHDTM questions on Monday.
 
Two trivial questions about the do this for /d1/workarea/dlxs/text/tel/dothis

 
The file starts with SECOND:  --  for the totally clueless (me) this is confusing.
 
#18 - cd to idx/WW and run make all (wordwheel) for each collection
 
Do you really mean:  cd to /d1/dlxs/bin/WW which is where the totally clueless (me) found the word wheel stuff.
 
Do not go to diglib2, paul is in the middle of upgrading it.
 

cheers!
cricket!
