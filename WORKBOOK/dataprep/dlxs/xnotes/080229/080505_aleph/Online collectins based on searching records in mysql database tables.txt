Subject: Online collectins based on searching records in mysql database
tables

Hi Paul,

If we want to develop a "home grown" digital library using Mysql tables and php code, we have to show it works in other Places.  I think I found one.

This url shows a variety of strategies for online digital libraries http://www.library.yale.edu/~dlovins/xml/alamods.html

From this url an example from Brown University.
http://dl.lib.brown.edu/ gateway to all collections

http://www.wwp.brown.edu/ women writers online

Note: she mentions that using a "Web Input Form" is important (I think We have that part covered)

cheers!
cricket!

Presenter: Ann Caldwell
metadata specialist at Brown University Library,[iv]
Topic: “Using MODS at Brown” 
Brown’s Center for Digital Initiatives (CDI) created October 2001 Using NoteTab Pro to facilitate MARC-to-MODS conversion. 
Importance of Interns 

University of Rhode Island Library School

150-hour commitment per student along with written synopsis

Many library students on second careers with varied transferable sills (e.g., those coming fom software industry) Scholarly Technology Group, subset of Brown ITS, involved in technology in support of classroom instruction

TEI-based Women Writers Project, 

Library worried it might duplicate such efforts 

But able to add value: knowledge of metadata standards MODS records at Brown either converted from MARC or built from scratch. 
NoteTab tool cheap and flexible; NoteTab Pro is 19.95. NoteTab Light is free. Brown library staff downloaded EAD clip library and modified it VRA and EAD records mapped to MODS using stylesheets VRA records exported from image management system, [v] EAD process simpler: already more similar to native MODS records Every record is part of collection, validated against XSL style sheet; stored in PHP-SQL database MODS elements reside in cataloger-designed tables that enable cross-collection searching, record retrieval and display via home-made XSL style sheet. 
Staffing 

1.66 additional professionals, 

1 paraprofessional, 

1 FTE temporary staff splitting time between graphic design and camera work 

Still rely on graduate students 

Current Projects 

20 plus active project currently; working with audio and video images as well.[vi] Web input form is important: empowers ordinary users to enter their own digital objects and metadata. 
Looking for staffing partners and new efficiencies, since digital backlog has now grown larger than Brown’s backlog of print materials.
