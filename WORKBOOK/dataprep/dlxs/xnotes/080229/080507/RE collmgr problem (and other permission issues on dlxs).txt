Subject: RE: collmgr problem (and other permission issues on dlxs)

I don't know why, but if diglib owns the lib directory and the lockfile directory below it, it works fine.

What we had was this:
[root@diglib2 collmgr]# ls -lai /d1/dlxs/lib/lockfile/ total 8
8290343 drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root         4096 Apr 29 14:22 .
8994817 drwxrwxr-x    6 125112   1089         4096 May  7 10:01 ..
8290318 -rw-rw-rw-    1 apache   apache          0 Apr 29 14:22 dbexist

I don't know who 125112 is, but root owned the lockfile directory. Apache had written the lockfile but then the directory permissions changed, and it couldn't get back in to remove it.

I removed that old lockfile (dbexist) and changed the ownership of both directories to diglib (that's what is working on diglib) and it freed up.

ah, ok.   What permissions need to be on the lockfile directory?
