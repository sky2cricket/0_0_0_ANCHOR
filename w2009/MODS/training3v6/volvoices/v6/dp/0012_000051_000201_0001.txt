'TO THE CITIZENS Or ROANE & MORGAN COUNTIES%
FRIENDS & CITIZENS :
THE time at which your duty and your laws require you to make a fit choice of a representative in the State Legislature, as well as in the Congress of the United States, is close at hand. My name has been placed before you for some time, as a candidate to represent your will and interest in the representative branch of the Legislature of Tennessee. I have not been urged to present my pretensions and views, appertaining to this highly honorable and justly important office, by the interested manmuvres of a few, nor to subserve the degaaded designs of modern law-makers ; but they have been pressed before yOn by the worthy desires of honest men. How far I may be able to meet the object of so flattering a call from my Fellow-Citizens, (should I be the object of your choice,) time and efforts to serve the best interests of my country, shall etc side. As I will not (in all probability) hrvc it in my power to see and converse with you all, before the election, I submit, through the medium of my letter, a brief of those measures Which demand attention, and which, the unheeded complaints of an injured country have often called for in vain.
THE first subject I shall submit to your consideration, Fellow-Citizens, is of the greatest importance to a community of freemen. I mean Education ; it is the life of Morality, the vital spring of religion, the unbending safe-guard of pure liberty. This important measure has been lung and shamefully neglected by those who have heretofore been entrusted with the dispensation of the wise and useful powers of the state government. It has, in times past, been the policy of those who have, by the aid of wealth and a little brief muthority, wielded the tyrant's scourge over demolished liberty, to stop the channels of information, to darken reason's light, and keep t he multitude in ignorance of their natural and political rights ; while the pampered and powerful, with their train of enfeebled offspring, should glut their appetites and satiate their wicked pride on the spoils and luxuries', arising from the lost property and Mangled priviiedges of men; free by nature's God. And what is more lamentable, Fellow-Citizens, those lordlings were not content to move in the glittering pomp, which the defeated toil and ruined labour of the uninformed and oppressed, could give them. But, should the people data to be restless, under their destroying pressure, or attempt to recover their lost'Creedom, they were cursed as impious rebels against good order, and lashed with the tyrant's whip. But we hope for better things in a government like ours, based on the interest and will of the people. In this happy transition from despotism to freedolu, we find that the people are the only sows greigns, the only true and legitimate source of authority.
WE have an overflowing Treasury at this important crisis of state affairs, applied to the promotion of no object of general usefulness. Indepebdent of the ordinary revenue (if the state, we have upwards of 400000 thousand dollars vested in the New Bank ; a large proportion of this sum is routed mat in proper proportions, to the people of the different counties. With the interest of this money we can pay all the 'expences of the New Bank, and lay off school districts throughout the state, and CT'0!210y a teacher in each, so that the poor and rich in a government of equal laws, may have the saline opportunity to have their children informed ug of their privileges as citizens, and their duties as christians. Let us make a beginning of this general plan of desired benefit to all, and thereby redeem from the mouldering rubbish of the forgotten and neglected, nature's brightest jewels, the slightest polish of which will make it shed its useful light, from the hidden retreads of poverty, to the summit of private and public utility. The districts should be so laid off' that all within, can send their children to the centre. Let us hire teachers for Um three winteh rnonth so that those who have to live by the labour of their children, will not be cut off from theih aid in harvest-time. You are, Fellow-Citizens, invoked by every solemn and charitable consideration, to make this useful experiment ; and as we increase in means we can extend this recovering scheme.-Nothing but Education will perpetuate your freedom, purify moral conduct, and harmonise every jading cord in society.
THE next measure, Fellow-Citizens, which I shall submit to your consideration is, Internal Improvement. We should tow begin to remove the obstructions in our rivers, Which prevent a free and profitable inter.-course with other people ; we should connect our waters with the rivers which lead to distant, but valuable markets. This should be done after the plan of the great Clinton, of New-Yohk, who has surmounted such fearful difficulties, and Worked such valuable wonders, with his Canals. These Canals have made Neva-York the idol and model of the Coinmercial, nay, of the Agricultural and Manufacturing interest of this great Hatton. This grand work, which has so successfully promoted the wealth and prosperity of a state, was clone by the Legislature of New-York, under thee guidance of that :Master spirit Qf bold enter prize and Magnanimity, which ever characterises great men and flourishing comMunities, No sordid feeling of men devoted to their own interest, and bent on their own exaltation, on the ruins of their country ; no servile adherence of boerowed greatness to accelarate the views of parties, leagued against the common good, entered into an assembly of such glen, to tarnish their honor and corrupt their hearts. No, Fellow-Citizens, stern honesty and firm fondness for their state's glory, made such Legislators watch the doors, and banish to disgrace such interested law-makers. We should do as has been done in Nctw-York, Pennsylvania, Upper Canada, and in Europe, incorporate companies by the Legislature, and authorise them to sell stock to an amount adequate the object. We find the Welland Canal of Upper Canada is to lie for sloop navigation, and that this stock is sought after with eagerness by the capitalists in London, as well as by the citizens of the United States. This kind of stock has ever been in the highest demand. In the state of Pennsylvania upwards of ten tbous.d workmen are now employed in cutting Canals. Here.the. former Ends market for his beef and corn, and the labourer employment. In such unclouded views of gO.n the state will find employment for her inac,ive fends; the capitehivt and miser, testis ;0: ilre t(' ,and nbr,gid,
