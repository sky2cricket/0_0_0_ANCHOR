Then you have to get rid of the existing 
/d1/dlxs/idx/v/vvi directory
rmdir vvi

Then you can run setupcollindex (UMICH program)
setupcollindex v/vvi > nameYourRedirect.txt

Then go to the new vvi directory you just made

[root@diglib2 vvi]# pwd
/d1/dlxs/idx/v/vvi
[root@diglib2 vvi]# ls
image.blank.dd  image.cfg  image.dd  image.idx  image.inp  image.rgn  Makefile  tags.txt

and run >> make all

Then do imageclass release to production
