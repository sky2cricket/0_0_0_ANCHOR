Subject: collmgr problem (and other permission issues on dlxs)

I think I fixed collmgr.  The problem had to do with permissions on the /d1/dlxs/lib directory and subdirectories -- the cgi script /d1/dlxs/cgi/c/collmgr/collmgr  couldn't remove the lockfile /d1/dlxs/lib/lockfile/dbexist

I think it's okay now.

We recently had other permission problems with dlxs -- when the /d1/dlxs/web/t/text directory was changed to ownership diglib, then apache couldn't write the images to gifcvtdir in that directory -- so page images wouldn't show up.

We need to remember these things for future errors of this sort!
Thank you!!
