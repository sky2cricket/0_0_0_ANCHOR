FROM /d1/workarea/dlxs/image/steps

I.  Changes to incoming xml file:
      (must fit image dtd)
        name of file needs to be all in small letters and in this
           format (ex: UTKgsm)
           ic.utkgsm.unnorm.sgm

II. put it in prep/_/_collectionname (_ has to match)
    and make sure there are no other such files in there!!!!

III. make directory img/_/_collectionname (_ has to match), with subdirectories
     thumb and large;  put thumbnails in thumb, large images in large.
     Make sure directories are 775, files are 664 permissions.

IV.  after putting your images in these folders, you need to run
     $DLXSROOT/bin/i/image/imageprep collid
     this creates an index directory of the image files that cgi uses to
     retrieve images more quickly.

V.   make directories (obj/_/_collname)( idb will give you an error if you forget)
     (idb is the step after next)

VI. (skip this with pre-generated sgml:)
     if you have more than Dublin Core: "Modify the "idb" program to add your
     metanames and abbreviations to the gGenMetaNamesHash. Then use your mappings
     in Record 3 of the configuration file. You will also need to use CollMgr to
     add the new mappings to the relevant collection groups."
     (http://docs.dlxs.org/class/image/image-datatransform.xml).

VII. Then run /bin/i/image/idb norm collid (correct any errors)
     (collid is the Coll ID from the sgml file)

VIII. (if you are re-indexing, remove idx/c/coll and its contents.)
       run bin/i/image/setupcollindex c/collid   (collid is as above, directory
       containing it must be named by its first letter)

IX.  go to the idx/c/collid directory (whatever that might be);
     correct makefile and do: "make all"

X.  add collection to /d1/dlxs/cgi/i/image/AUTHZD_COLL

XI. add collection to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf under PUBLIC_COLL
    <Directory "/d1/dlxs/cgi/i/image">
      SetEnv AUTHZD_COLL ":"
      SetEnv PUBLIC_COLL ":sampleic:workshopic:utkgsm:"
    </Directory>

XII. run /etc/init.d/httpd restart

XIII. go to Collmgr and create the collection;  make a release to production
     make sure host is "localhost" and dd is filename of correct dd (no path)
     Entrydivsdefault can only have one entry:  full image, description,
     or other views;
     the order needs to be just like that in the fields where you use more.
     Make the fields match the others before experimenting, including which
     dd file you use.  Try image.dd first.

XIV.  go to Collmgr and manage groups;  edit collection "all";  add this
      collection to "all"; release to production

XV. go to cgi/i/image and run makeCollectionmaps-idx (every time you update
      the collection on collmgr also)
