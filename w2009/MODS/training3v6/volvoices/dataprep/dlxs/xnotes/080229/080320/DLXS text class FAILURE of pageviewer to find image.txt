Subject: DLXS text class FAILURE of pageviewer to find image

The /d1/dlxs/web/t/text/gifcvtdir MUST belong to user apache!
 The software runs as the apache user, and copies images from the obj  subdirectories to this location.  The delivered html page obtains its image from this web directory.
   
When this problem appears, files that already have images in the web directory will work properly, so it seems that only some text pages are not available.  Check permissions!!  
Repair instructions:
 
cd  /d1/dlxs/web/t/text
chown apache *
cd gifcvtdir
chown apache *
chown apache */*
