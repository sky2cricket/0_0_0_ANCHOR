note_081102.txt

I rewrote step_06.py (which replaces out of range characters with html hex entities)
to step_82.py (which reports out of range characters and writes those files to subdirectory)

I tested xml, Receive0, ocr, txt directories for

080107 - 02 - 04
080201 - 02 - 03  -04
080416 - 03
080812 - 02 - 04


The only place I found out of range characters was 28 files in
080416/03/txt

I fixed these by hand.

I was keeping detailed notes, but unfortunately, my home computer turned itself off
and I lost all notes.

This was the last data validation on import.  Ready to go tomorrow.
