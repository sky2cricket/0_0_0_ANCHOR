<h1>Introducing DLXS XPAT</h1> <p>DLXS XPAT is a tool for
searching text. You type a prefix, word, or phrase; DLXS XPAT tells you how
many times it appears in the text. You can then print all or some
fraction of the matches, each match surrounded by some context. You can
find prefixes, words or phrases that appear near other specified text,
or find those that appear most often. Searches can also be restricted to
certain parts of the text. Whoever installs DLXS XPAT to work with a
particular document defines what characters signal the beginning of a
prefix, word, or phrase; what characters (if any) should be interpreted
by DLXS XPAT as other characters (upper case characters to lower, for
example); and whether DLXS XPAT should ignore certain characters completely
(common words, for example).</p>


<h2>How to Use This Manual</h2>
<p><!-- keyword: getting started -->This manual was written to help you get
started using DLXS XPAT and to serve as a reference guide once you become
more familiar with the program. The chart on the facing page outlines
where you can go in the manual to get the type of information you need.
For example, if you are a new user of DLXS XPAT and are in a hurry to get
started, you may want to turn to the section "Trying Out Commands".</p>

<p>This manual was not written to help you install or set DLXS XPAT up on
your system. For installation information, refer to the <i>DLXS XPAT Installation
Guide.</i></p>

<p>Some particulars of DLXS XPAT will vary from system to system, such as
whether upper case characters are translated to lower case, or what
DLXS XPAT considers a word. The section "How DLXS XPAT Searches" outlines some
of the possibilities.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: example text -->The main texts used for examples are the
first edition of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> and Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle's <i>Hound of the Baskervilles</i>. Although your
understanding and use of DLXS XPAT will be strongly influenced by the text
you are searching, these two texts will
show the characteristics of searching a straightforward text structure
like that of <i>Hound of the Baskervilles</i> as compared with the
highly complex text structure found in <i>The Oxford English
Dictionary.</i></p>
<p><!-- keyword: conventions -->This manual is divided into two-page
spreads where the right page presents the textual or explanatory
information and the left page presents the visual or exemplary
information. DLXS XPAT commands that appear on the right page (in bold) are
more fully developed in a real example on the left. Technical or
unfamiliar uses of words appear in italics the first time they are used
and are fully defined in the glossary.</p>  

 

<h2>What is DLXS XPAT?</h2> 
<!-- index: Tags --><!-- index: to mark components of text -->
<dl>
<dt>Prefix</dt><dd>In the linguistic sense, a prefix is
an element placed before a word or stem to form another word. In
this manual, the term is used to describe any character(s)
(letters, numbers, or special characters) that start a word regardless
of whether they form a grammatical prefix.</dd>

<dt>Word</dt><dd>In the linguistic sense, a word is a
meaningful element surrounded by a space on either side. In this manual,
the term also includes elements that are not necessarily
surrounded by a space on either side (a word that appears flush beside a
tag, as in <i>&lt;p>The</i>, for example).  What DLXS XPAT considers a
word is defined at the time of index building.</dd>

<dt>Phrase</dt><dd>In the linguistic sense, a phrase is a
group of words that plays a particular role in a sentence. In this
manual, phrase refers to any sequence of characters containing more than
one word. See
<i>Word</i>.</dd>

<dt>Tags</dt><dd>Tags are often used to label the start
and end of an element in the text for ease of retrieval. For example,
the tag <i>&lt;Q></i> identifies the start of a quotation
and the tag <i>&lt;/Q></i> identifies its end.
Tags represent descriptive markup when they describe
what the text is rather than how it should be formatted.</dd>

 <p><!-- keyword: searching text -->DLXS XPAT is a tool for searching
text. You can use DLXS XPAT to search for <i>prefixes</i>,
<i>words</i>, or <i>phrases</i>. DLXS XPAT can search for a lengthy
phrase as quickly as for a single word. DLXS XPAT can also search for text
that appears near other specified text and for text that appears
frequently.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: restricting search area -->Using DLXS XPAT, you can search
through the entire text or only a portion. For example, a search through
a collection of technical papers can be restricted to only the
abstracts. Restricting searches to selected components of text is
easiest when the text contains <i>tags</i> that mark the start and
end of each component (<i>&lt;abstract></i> and
<i>&lt;/abstract></i>, for example). A collection of technical
papers that has its titles, authors, abstracts, and content marked by
different tags can be easily segmented into portions for searching
(see facing page).</p>

<p><!-- keyword: applying DLXS XPAT -->DLXS XPAT can be used to search a variety of
texts, everything from dictionaries, encyclopedias, or literary works to
business texts such as insurance policies or contracts. The following
examples show how DLXS XPAT can be used to satisfy a variety of search
requests.</p>

<ul><li>A student searches an encyclopedia for all entries that
contain the word <i>revolution</i> near the word
<i>french</i> or <i>France</i>.</li>

<li>A statistician searches a collection of insurance files
to find the most popular types of policies.</li>

<li>A Shakespearean scholar finds the most frequently cited
work by Shakespeare in a collection of literary journals.</li>

<li>A computer scientist searches through a collection of technical
papers, retrieving the titles of the papers written by a certain author.</li>

<li>A linguist searches a dictionary for the number
of English words that have Old Norman French in their etymology and are
still in current use.</li>

<li>A lexicographer creates a <i>concordance</i> of a text consisting of
all words that begin with the letter <i>j</i>.</li>

<li>A literary scholar searches for long repeated phrases of text in a
work, aiming to discover the author's favourite expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's assume someone has installed the text file you want to search
and the DLXS XPAT program on your system according to the
procedures outlined in the <i>DLXS XPAT Installation Guide</i>.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: starting DLXS XPAT -->To start DLXS XPAT, type <tt>pat</tt>,
followed by the name of the file that contains the text you want to
search. For example, if <tt>research</tt> is the name of your text
file, the command is:</p>

<pre>pat research</pre>

<p>The <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> <i>prompt</i> appears once you have
successfully started DLXS XPAT. This means DLXS XPAT is ready for your first
search instruction. After each instruction to DLXS XPAT, press the
<tt>Enter</tt> or <tt>Return</tt> key.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: interrupting DLXS XPAT -->To interrupt DLXS XPAT in the middle of
a search or the printing of results, press the key or sequence of keys
that normally performs an interrupt function on your keyboard (commonly the
<tt>Delete</tt> key or a <tt>Control c</tt> key sequence).</p>

<p><!-- keyword: leaving DLXS XPAT -->When you are ready to leave DLXS XPAT, type
<tt>stop</tt>, <tt>quit</tt>, or <tt>done</tt> after the prompt:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; stop</pre>

<p>A message displays how much computer time you used in
the DLXS XPAT session.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Match point</dt><dd>The match point is the first
letter of the matched text. If you search for <i>car</i>, for
example, the match point is <i>c</i>. The match point normally
appears as the 15th character printed as the result of a <tt>pr</tt>
command (not including the initial <i>..</i>). It serves as a
reference point for the match. For example, the position of the match
point (the number that appears at the beginning of a line of context)
can be used to retrieve the match.</dd>

<dt>Pattern</dt><dd>A pattern is the text that you ask
DLXS XPAT to search for. DLXS XPAT tries to find the same sequence of characters
in the text. If it does, a match results.</dd>

<dt>Set number</dt><dd>A set number identifies a specific
set of results. Each time you do a search, DLXS XPAT assigns the results a
set number. You can use this number to later reference this set. The
<tt>history</tt> command gives you a list of all your previous sets
and their numbers.</dd>

<dt>Character  </dt><dd>A character includes anything that
can be entered on a keyboard. This includes letters, numbers, punctuation
marks, spaces and special characters such as percent signs, hash marks,

<p>The first time you use DLXS XPAT, the screen conventions will be
unfamiliar. The facing page labels the important information on the
screen.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: prompt -->The <i>&gt;&gt;</i> prompt means DLXS XPAT is ready
to accept a command. Typing a prefix, word, phrase, number or other
text after the prompt and pressing the <tt>Enter</tt> or
<tt>Return</tt> key starts the search, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; tall</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: search pattern -->What you type is often referred to as a search pattern or
<i>pattern</i> for short.</p>

<p>After you enter a pattern, DLXS XPAT displays a line like the
following:</p>

<pre>1: 9 matches</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: set number -->The number <i>1</i> is called the
<i>set number</i>. It names a set of results with a number so you
can use it in further searches. Following the set number is the result
of the search. The number <i>9</i> is the number of times the
pattern <i>tall</i> appears in the example text.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: pr command -->The <tt>pr</tt> command (short for
print) shows one line of context around each occurrence of the search
pattern, for example:</p>
<pre>
95641, .., and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless..
</pre>
<p><!-- keyword: match point -->The number in front stands for the
position of the first character of the match (referred to as
the <i>match point</i>). In the example, the letter <i>t</i> in
<i>tall</i> is the 95,641st character in the text.</p>

<p>For each match, DLXS XPAT prints two periods followed by 64
<i>characters</i> (14 to the left of the match point and 49 to the
right) followed by two more periods. Note that spaces and punctuation
as well as letters, numbers, and other symbols count as
characters.</p>

  <p>To practise some of the basics of DLXS XPAT and
become familiar with the search terminology, try searches similar to 
those that follow. If you run into difficulties, consult the error
charts in Appendix A.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: word occurrences -->Type a word to find the number of
times it appears in the text. Make sure you put it in quotation marks
and leave a space after it:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "hound  "</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: phrase occurrences -->Similarly, to find the number
of times a phrase appears in the text, put the phrase in quotation
marks and leave a space after the final word:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; "my dear Watson  "</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: prefix occurrences -->To look up words that start a
certain way, type the pattern with <i>or</i> without quotation
marks. The following finds the number of times the word
<i>murder</i> and words starting with <i>murder</i>
appear:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; "murder"</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: printing the results -->To print a line of context for every
occurrence of the previous pattern, type the following:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr</pre>

<p>To print results for a set other than the previous, give the set
number:</p>

<p>Printing one line of context for every occurrence often provides you
with too much or too little information: too much if you only want to
look at a few results and too little if you require more
than one line of context to make sense of the results.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: printing fewer matches -->The <tt>sample</tt> command
selects and prints 10 matches from the total set of results. DLXS XPAT
chooses 10 matches that are evenly spaced throughout the text. You can
print a different number of matches by appending a period and a number
to the command:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr sample.5</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: printing more context -->The next command prints 100
characters of context around every occurrence: the standard 14
characters to the left of the match point and 85 characters to the
right:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.100</pre>

<p>The following command prints 200 characters of context around the
first match only:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.200 [273511]</pre>

<p>Notice that the amount of context to the left of the match point
stays constant (14 characters no matter how many characters are
printed). To see more to the left, decrease the character position. For
example, to see the same amount of context as above but to centre it
roughly around the match point, subtract 100 (half of 200) from the
character position:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.200 [273411]</pre>

<p>Another way to get the same result is to use the
<tt>shift</tt> command to do the subtraction for you:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.200 shift.-100 [273511]</pre>

<h2>How DLXS XPAT Searches</h2>

<p><!-- keyword: exact matching -->DLXS XPAT takes what you type and looks for
an exact replica in the text. You can match any prefixes,
words, or phrases that appear in the text by typing each as it appears. 
DLXS XPAT then takes your pattern of characters and tries to find the
same pattern in the text; DLXS XPAT has no knowledge of the meaning of the
text and no built-in information about synonyms to words you type.</p>

<p>It is important to think of DLXS XPAT strictly as a pattern matcher so
you can interpret your results accurately. For example, if
you are using DLXS XPAT to search an encyclopedia for references to insects,
typing <i>insect</i> is a logical starting point. You will find
all occurrences to the pattern <i>insect</i>; that is, all words
that start with the characters
<i>i</i>,<i>n</i>,<i>s</i>,<i>e</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>However, there are many categories and classes of insects (bug, fly,
vermin) not to mention specific types of insects (ladybug, louse,
earwig) or even variant names of a specific insect (ladybug, ladybird or
lady beetle). Furthermore, the term <i>insect</i> might be
misspelled in the text. None of the above occurrences will be retrieved
by searching for <i>insect</i>. You must anticipate what words
might be used in the text to describe the type of information you are
after. It is the person at the keyboard, not DLXS XPAT, who investigates
and provides the appropriate search terms.</p>

</pre>

 <p><!-- keyword: character indexing -->DLXS XPAT knows nothing about
grammatical constructs like words or phrases. DLXS XPAT can be set up so
that when you type a pattern like <i>light</i>, the program looks for
this pattern <i>anywhere</i> in the text, for example, within
<i>delighted</i>, <i>lighted</i> or as the word
<i>light</i>. Every character in the text can be matched, or more
technically, every character is <i>indexed</i>.  See the facing page
for an example.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: word indexing -->It is not always desirable that every
character be indexed. The example texts used in this manual are indexed
at the beginning of each word, tag, or hyphenated stem, for example:
<i>l</i>ight, <i>&lt;</i>chap>, and <i>-</i>bottle or
       <i>b</i>ottle in <i>brandy-bottle</i>. In other words, you
can search for any pattern that starts with a <i>-</i> or
<i>&lt;</i>, or appears in the text following a <i>-</i> or
space. It is normally more useful to index by word beginnings (unless
you are interested in searching <i>suffixes</i>). You specify what
type of index you wish to build as part of the index building procedure
for a particular text. See the <i>DLXS XPAT Installation Guide</i> for
more details.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: ends of words -->Notice that DLXS XPAT knows nothing about the
ends of words. DLXS XPAT simply finds whatever begins with what you type.
The pattern <i>light</i> results in anything that starts with the
characters <i>light</i>, which accounts for the match to
<i>lighted</i> on the facing page. Similarly, the pattern
<i>"light  "</i> results in anything that starts with the
characters <i>light</i> followed by a space ( DLXS XPAT does not
understand this as a word, just as a sequence of characters, one of
which happens to be a space).</p>

<!-- index: Upper case searching --> 
<!-- index: Case sensitivity --> 
<!-- index: Stop words -->
<dl>
<dt>Character mapping</dt><dd>Characters can be
substituted for or mapped to other characters. For example, a period can
be mapped to a space so that a search for a word followed by a space
also gets occurrences of the word followed by a period. Similarly, upper
case characters can be mapped to lower case.  Character mappings are
defined at the time of index building.</dd>

<dt>Stop words</dt><dd>Stop words are words that DLXS XPAT
treats as if they do not exist in the text. These are often common words
like <i>the</i> or <i>a.</i> Stop words are defined at the
time of index building.</dd>

o my luve s like a red red rose that s newly sprung in june

</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: character mapping -->Consider a search for the pattern
<i>"tall  "</i>. Although your aim is to search for the word
<i>tall</i>, DLXS XPAT is searching for an exact match to the
characters <i>t</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>l</i>,
<i>l</i> followed by a space. If <i>tall</i> appears at the
end of a sentence, it may be followed with a period, question mark or
some punctuation other than a space. Similarly, if it begins a sentence
it may have an initial capital.</p>

<p>Fortunately, DLXS XPAT can be set up at index building time to interpret
specific characters in the text as if they were other characters. For
example, DLXS XPAT can be told to interpret a period or question mark as a
space or an upper case character as its lower case equivalent. This is
called <i>character mapping.</i> The facing page shows punctuation
marks mapped to spaces, and upper case characters to lower case
characters. Notice that when character mapping results in two spaces in
a row (<i>,</i> and space, for example), DLXS XPAT  condenses these to
a single space. All characters remain as they are in the text; DLXS XPAT
only sees the difference when searching.</p>

<p>If you search for a word (by leaving a space
after it) and get back the word with a character other than a space
after it, it means that DLXS XPAT treats this character as a space.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: stop words -->At index building time, you can also tell
DLXS XPAT to ignore certain words completely. It is often useful to ignore
common words, like <i>and</i> or   <i>the</i>, sometimes
referred to as <i>stop words</i>. Here, a search for
<i>the</i> would not result in a match. A search for <i>wind
rain</i> would match the phrase <i>wind and rain</i>.</p>

<p>Instructions for specifying these features are part of the
installation procedure defined in the <i>DLXS XPAT Installation
Guide.</i></p>   

<h1>Basic Searching</h1> 

<p>The most basic search in DLXS XPAT is simply to type some text after
the prompt. DLXS XPAT finds all matches to that text. For example, a search
for <i>start</i> could result in <i>start</i>,
<i>starts</i>, <i>startle</i> or any text that begins with
<i>start</i>. When you only want complete words, you add a space
to the end of your search pattern and enclose it within quotation marks.
DLXS XPAT responds to a search by displaying the number of times the pattern
appears in the text. You can then choose to print some or all the
matches in alphabetical order or in order of position of text, with some
context displayed around each match. You may also choose to save your
results in a file, rather than display them on the screen. To help you
keep track of your progress, DLXS XPAT keeps a summary of what searches you
have made and their results.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: searching -->You start a search by typing a pattern of
text. You can type any arrangement of characters including
prefixes, words, phrases, and numbers.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; skirt</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "autobiography  "</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "old autocrat  "</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "18"</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: quotation marks -->If the pattern contains spaces (as in the
second and third examples), numbers, non-letter characters like
<i>&lt;</i>, or names of commands, you <i>must</i> put the
pattern in quotation marks. If it contains none of the above, DLXS XPAT
accepts it with or without quotation marks.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: number of occurrences -->After a search, DLXS XPAT tells you
how many time the pattern appears; it does not automatically display the
results.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: printing -->To display the results, use the
<tt>pr</tt> command:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr</pre>

<p>You can combine a <tt>pr</tt> command and search pattern on the
same line, as the last example on the facing page shows. However,
when you do, no set number results. The results are not saved and you
cannot access the results later without typing the pattern again.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: stopping display -->If there is more than a screenful of
matches, the results will scroll off the screen. Your computer has key
sequences that allow you to stop and start scrolling (<tt>Control s</tt>
and <tt>Control q</tt> on some systems). Check your
computer manual.</p>

<p>To stop the display of the matches completely, use the key or
sequence of keys that normally performs an interrupt function on your
keyboard (commonly the <tt>Delete</tt> key or a <tt>Control c</tt>
key sequence). The DLXS XPAT prompt redisplays on your screen, awaiting
your next search.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: more to right -->DLXS XPAT normally displays 64 characters of
context for a match, 14 before the match point and 49 after. This may
not be enough. To increase the number of characters displayed to the
right of the match, follow the command with a period and a number that
serves as a <i>modifier</i>. For example, to display 100 characters
of context (14 before and 85 after the match point):</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.100 "elementary  "</pre>

<p>You can also print more around one match instead of the whole set:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.145 [3393]</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can change the number of characters normally printed (from 64 to
145, for example):</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; {PrintLength 145}</pre>

<p>From now on, DLXS XPAT prints 145 characters unless you modify <tt>pr</tt> 
or change this value.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: more on both sides -->To increase the context on both sides,
increase the number of characters printed to the right and decrease the
position number. For example, subtract 100 from the position number and
print forward 200.</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.200 [3293]</pre> 

<p>A second way is to use the <tt>shift</tt> command to decrease the
position number (move the match point back). Then use the <tt>pr</tt>
command to print forward from that point.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.200 shift.-100 [3393]</pre>

<p>Simply leave out the position number if you want to see more around the
entire set of results:</p>

<p><!-- keyword: changing the match point -->The <tt>shift</tt> command changes
the match point. At the same time, <tt>shift</tt> reorders the
original matches in the order in which they appear in the text, rather
than in alphabetical order. This means that what was listed first in the
original set will not necessarily be listed first in the shifted
set.</p>

<p>When you search for a pattern, DLXS XPAT regards the first letter of the
pattern as the match point. When you print the results of a search (see
facing page), the match points line up at the 15th character. A
<tt>shift</tt> command creates new match points from characters to the
right or left of the original match points; for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; shift.10</pre>

<p>A shift of 10 makes a new match point 10 characters after the original
one. (A shift of -10 makes a new match point 10 characters before
the match point). When you print the results, the new match points
appear at the 15th character of each line.</p>

<p>A shift of a positive number allows you to see more context to the
right of the original match and a shift of a negative number allows you
to see more context to the left.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: saving the results of a shift -->DLXS XPAT shifts the previous
set of matches. If you print and shift on the same line, DLXS XPAT does not
record the set (no set number results). Consequently if you shift again,
you will shift from the original set, not the previously-displayed
results. However, if you shift and print separately, DLXS XPAT does record
a set and you will shift from the new results, not the original set.</p>

 <p><!-- keyword: sample of 10 -->In a lengthy text, you
may only need to look at a fraction of the results. You can look at 10
matches, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; the</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; sample</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; pr</pre>

<p>DLXS XPAT provides a sample by taking matches that are evenly spread
throughout the text. For example, DLXS XPAT chooses 10 matches
from a set of 100 matches by taking 1 from the first 10
matches, 1 from the next 10, and so on.</p>

<p>To see different matches, you must change the size of the sample taken;
otherwise you get the same matches.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: changing the sample size -->You can change the size of the
sample by following the command with a number that serves as a modifier.
For example, to get 5 matches and print the results:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr sample.5</pre>

<p>Without a modifier, DLXS XPAT retrieves 10 matches. You can change the
number retrieved for a single command by using a modifier as above. You
can also change the number DLXS XPAT normally prints without a modifier. To
change the number normally provided to 4, type the following:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; {SampleSize 4}</pre>

<p>From this point until you leave DLXS XPAT, whenever you sample without a
modifier, DLXS XPAT retrieves this new number of matches. However, if you
give a modifier, DLXS XPAT gets the number you specify, regardless of the
<tt>{SampleSize}</tt> setting.</p>

</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: concordances -->You can search for a range of patterns
such as a range of letters or numbers. An example of a range is every
word that starts with <i>a</i> through the alphabet to every word
that starts with <i>z</i>. This alphabetical arrangement of words
or phrases in a text is known as a <i>concordance</i>. To display a
full concordance of text, type the following:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr "a".."z"</pre>

<p>When the list is lengthy, use the key that normally interrupts to
stop the display (commonly the <tt>Delete</tt> key or a <tt>Control
c</tt> key sequence). A sample of a smaller range of letters,
<i>be</i> through <i>bu</i>, appears on the facing page.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: number ranges -->An example of a search for a range of
numbers is all text that starts with <i>1880</i> up to and
including all text that starts with <i>1890</i>. Range searching
on numbers can be useful for searching numeric constructs like dates.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr "1880".."1890"</pre>  

<p>In this example, all the numbers happen to represent dates. However,
numbers such as <i>18801</i> or <i>18823</i> could also
result from this search since these start with characters in the range
<i>1880..1890</i>.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: full range -->Occasionally, you may want to retrieve
every match point in the text. Double quotation marks (<i>""</i>)
represent the set of all match points in the text, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr ""</pre>

<p>Since the example text is indexed by word start, this prints a sorted
list of all words: those starting with <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>
(the concordance example), numbers, and special characters. In the
example on the facing page, the display was stopped after the hyphen,
the first character sorted.</p>

Saving in references
</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: similar to pr -->Rather than displaying the
results of a search on the screen, you can save them in a file. The
<i>default</i> filename is <tt>pat.results</tt>. This means that
unless you specify otherwise (see below), results will be appended to
the file of that name. The results appear in exactly the same format in
the file as they would on the screen.  The <tt>save</tt> command takes
all the same modifiers that <tt>pr</tt> does, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; save.200 handsome</pre>

<p>In the above example, DLXS XPAT stores 200 characters for each match.
The next time you save, the results will be added to the end of the
<tt>pat.results</tt> file; any results already in this file will stay
intact.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: specify filename -->If you prefer, you can have the
results placed in a file of your choice. The following command
designates the file <tt>references</tt> as the place to put subsequent
results:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; {SaveFile "references"}</pre>

<p>The results of your next <tt>save</tt> command are added to the
file <tt>references</tt> in your current directory. This is in effect
until you change the name again or leave the program.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: position order -->DLXS XPAT normally sorts matches
alphabetically, except after <tt>shift</tt> commands when the sorting
is by position in the text (first to last). This default mode of
printing is known as <tt>{PrintMode 0}</tt>. You can change the mode
of printing so DLXS XPAT prints in order of position for the duration of the
session:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; {PrintMode 2}</pre>

<p>Generating a concordance doesn't make much sense in this
mode since the results will not be alphabetical.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: alphabetical order -->DLXS XPAT will sort by position until

<p>You can also change the mode of printing so that DLXS XPAT prints in

<p>The results now print in alphabetical order (including results of
<tt>shift</tt> commands).</p>




<h1>Refining Searches</h1> 

<p>Searching for some patterns may yield a large set of results. You
may wish to narrow down your set of results by making your search more
specific. Proximity searches allow you to find only those matches to a
pattern that are within or outside a certain distance of another
pattern. You can also search for the most frequent occurrences of
certain patterns or long patterns that appear more than once in the
text.</p>

<dt>Proximity </dt><dd>Proximity refers to the position of
one thing in relation to another. DLXS XPAT allows you to define at what

define this distance as a number of characters.</dd>

<dt>Proximity range</dt><dd>Proximity range refers to the
number of characters used to determine whether two or more patterns are
proximate to one another. For example, the normal proximity range is
80; that is, the first letter of the second pattern must appear 80

</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: proximity definition --><i>Proximity</i> is the
closeness of one piece of text to another. DLXS XPAT has four proximity
commands (<tt>near</tt>, <tt>fby</tt>, <tt>not near</tt> and
<tt>not fby</tt>). An example of each follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; "war  " fby "peace  "</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "war  " near "peace  "</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "war  " not fby "peace  "</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "war  " not near "peace  "</pre>

<p>The first example matches on occurrences of <i>war</i> that are
followed within 80 characters by <i>peace</i>.
The second example matches on occurrences that are followed
<i>or</i> preceded by <i>peace</i>. The third and fourth
examples find occurrences of <i>war</i> that are not followed by
or not near <i>peace</i>.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: proximity range -->The number of characters used to
determine proximity is referred to as the <i>proximity range</i>.
Normally the proximity range is 80 characters measured from the
<i>first letter</i> of the first pattern to the <i>first
letter</i> of the second pattern. For <tt>near</tt> and
<tt>fby</tt>, a match results if the two patterns are within this
distance of each other. For <tt>not near</tt> and <tt>not fby</tt>,
a match results if the two patterns are not within this distance of
each other.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: match point -->When you print the results of these
searches, the first letter of the first pattern (<i>w</i>) lines
up in the 15th column since DLXS XPAT considers it the match point. The
second pattern (<i>peace</i>) may not appear in the display at all
if your line length is short. Consequently, you may have to display a
few lines of text so that you can see both references. (See the
first example on the facing page.)</p>

<p><!-- keyword: changing proximity range -->You can change the
proximity range by adding a modifier to any of the proximity commands.
Varying the modifier can sometimes significantly change the results. To
increase the range to 150, for example, use a modifier as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; "war  " fby.150 "peace  "</pre>

<p>Notice from the facing page that this change increases the number of
matches (89 as compared to 71 without the modifier).</p>

<p><!-- keyword: changing default range -->Using a modifier changes the
proximity range for a single command. You can also change what DLXS XPAT
considers the default or normal proximity range (80 characters). To
change this value to 100, the command is as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; {Proximity 100}</pre>

<p>From now on, any proximity commands you type without a modifier will
use 100 as the proximity range.</p>

<p><b>2  Finding the Most Frequent Four-Word Phrase</b></p>

<p><b>3  Finding the Most Frequent Word or Phrase Within a Set</b></p>

<p>Every time you search for a pattern, DLXS XPAT tells you how many times
it appears in the text. If you're interested in the frequency of
specific patterns, this is the easiest way to get at that information.
However, if you're interested in the frequency of text in general, DLXS XPAT
provides a command called <tt>signif</tt> which displays a list of the
most frequent words or phrases in the text.</p>

<p>There are three main ways to use
this command:</p>

<ol> 
<li><p><!-- keyword: most to least frequent -->Search for the most frequent words
or phrases in order of most to least frequent (<tt>-3</tt> stands for
the three most frequent). Note the <i>-</i> before the number.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.-3 ""</pre>

<p>From the passage on the facing page, the three most frequent words or phrases are <i>the</i>, <i>of</i>, and <i>a</i>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><!-- keyword: fixed number of words -->Search for the most frequent
phrases of a specified length in words (<tt>4</tt> stands for a length of
four words). There is no <i>-</i> in this form of the command.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.4 ""</pre>

<p>The most frequent four-word phrase in the passage is <i>the
date for a</i>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><!-- keyword: extending a phrase -->Search for the most frequent
word or phrase. Then, extend the word or phrase further by searching for
frequent words and phrases within the first set of results.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif ""</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; signif</pre>

<p>The most frequent word or phrase in the passage is <i>the</i>.
The most frequent word or phrase following these occurrences is
<i>date for a</i>.</p></li>
</ol> 

<p>The following pages discuss each of the three applications in detail.</p>

</pre>

<ol>
<li><p><!-- keyword: most to least frequent -->The first application of
<tt>signif</tt> allows you to search for the most frequent words and
phrases.</p>

<p>For example, you can search for the four
most frequent words or phrases within a text:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.-4 ""</pre>

<p>Other words or phrases in the text may appear just as frequently
as the last one listed. In the example above, if there were three
phrases tied for fourth position only one would be listed.</p>

<p>You can also search for the four
most frequent words and phrases that begin as specified, for
example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.-4 the</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.-4 "the  "</pre>

<p>The first command uses the prefix <i>the</i> as the starting
point while the second uses the word <i>the</i>. Notice the
difference between the results of these two (see facing page). DLXS XPAT
selects the word <i>the</i> as the most frequent word or phrase
from those beginning with the prefix <i>the</i>. DLXS XPAT selects
the phrase <i>the moor</i> as the most frequent phrase beginning
with the word <i>the</i>.</p>

<p>The first results would be identical to the second if the prefix
<i>the</i> only appeared as the word <i>the</i>
(never started another word like <i>then</i> or
<i>there</i>).</p>

<li><p><!-- keyword: fixed number of words -->The second application of
<tt>signif</tt> allows you to search for the most frequent phrase of a
specified length (in words).</p>

<p>For example, you can search for the most
frequent phrase of three words in the text:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.3 ""</pre>

<p>In the example above, if three phrases tied for top position,
only one would be listed.</p>

<p>You can also search for frequent three-word phrases that
begin as specified, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.3 the</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; signif.3 "the "</pre>

<p>The first command uses the prefix <i>the</i> as the starting
point while the second uses the word <i>the</i>. Notice the
difference between the results of these two (see facing page). The most
frequent three-word phrase beginning with the prefix
<i>the</i> is <i>there is no</i> but the most frequent
three-word phrase beginning with the word <i>the</i> is
<i>the death of</i>.</p>

<p>The first results would be identical to the second if the prefix
<i>the</i> only appeared as the word <i>the</i>
(never started another word like <i>then</i> or
<i>there</i>).</p>

<p>DLXS XPAT may return more words than you specify if the phrase continues
to repeat after that number of words. For example, if the most frequent
three-word phrase is <i>the death of</i> but all
occurrences of this phrase are followed by the words <i>Sir
Charles</i>, DLXS XPAT will return five words: <i>the death of Sir
Charles</i>.</p></li>

<li><p><!-- keyword: extending a phrase -->The third
application of <tt>signif</tt> allows you to search for the most
frequent word or phrase and extend the word or phrase further by
searching within this new set.</p>

<p>Suppose you search for the most frequent word or phrase in the text
and the result is a set of matches to the word <i>the</i>. If you
want to find the most frequent phrases in this set (the set of all
phrases beginning <i>the</i>) you can reapply <tt>signif</tt>
again. You can continue doing so until you run out of repeated sequences
of text beginning <i>the</i>.</p>

<p>For example, you can search for the most frequent
word or phrase in the text and then extend the phrase further:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif ""</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; signif</pre>

<p>If there is a tie for the most frequent word or phrase, only one
is listed.</p>

<p>You can also search for frequent
words or phrases that begin as specified, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; signif the</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; signif "the "</pre>

<p>In each case, you can extend the phrase further by later
<tt>signif</tt> commands with no modifiers.</p>

<p><tt>signif</tt> with no modifier is exactly the same as
<tt>signif.-1</tt>.</p>

<p>Notice the difference between the results of the last two commands
(see facing page). The most frequent word or phrase beginning with the

<p><!-- keyword: definition -->The <tt>lrep</tt> command, like
<tt>signif</tt>, helps you find words or phrases that are repeated
somewhere else in the text. Instead of finding frequent repetitions of
text, <tt>lrep</tt> finds the longest repetitions in the text.</p>

<p>Long repetitions of text may show that one part of the text was copied from another or perhaps reveal phrases or cliches in the language.</p>

<p>The following command will find the longest repeated phrase in the text:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; lrep ""</pre>

<p>DLXS XPAT returns with a statement telling you the length of the repeated phrase and the number of matches of that length. Refer to the facing page for an example.</p>

<p>You can also find the longest repeated phrase that starts as specified; for example, with the word <i>one</i>:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; lrep "one "</pre>

<p>Like <tt>signif</tt>, if you do not specify some starting text, <tt>lrep</tt> works on the previous match set.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: modify length -->If you only want repeated text that is longer than a certain number of characters, you can modify the <tt>lrep</tt> command. For example, to search for repeated phrases of 50 or more characters, type:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; lrep.50 "one "</pre>




<h1>Searching Components of Text</h1><p>It is often
useful to restrict your search to selected components of the text.  You
may want to restrict your search to logical components of a text, such
as titles, abstracts or chapters, for example. Or you may want to
restrict your search to a continuous chunk of text, the first three
chapters of a book, for example. Besides searching for and displaying a
pattern within the restricted area, you can search for and display the
start of the text component that contains a pattern: the start of the
abstract or chapter that contains a word, for example. You can also
display the complete component of text that contains the pattern: the
complete abstract, for example. You can define the components of the
text within which you want to search either at the time of index
building or during a DLXS XPAT session.</p>


<h2>Restricting Your Search Area</h2>

<!-- index: Tags --><!-- index: to mark components of text -->

<pre>

&lt;title&gt;
Red, Red Rose
&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;content&gt;
O, my luve's like a red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June.
O, my luve is like the melodie
That's sweetly played in tune.
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;author&gt;
Robert Burns
&lt;/author&gt;

</pre>

<p>DLXS XPAT searches for a pattern anywhere in the text. There may be
times, however, when you want to restrict your search to certain logical
components of the text. In a typical novel, these components might be
the chapter titles, the chapters, or paragraphs. In a highly-structured
text like a dictionary, there may be many components: the main words,
pronunciations, etymologies, definitions and quotations, to name a few
possibilities. Or you may want to restrict your search to one chunk of
text such as an individual chapter or all the dictionary entries for the
letter <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: tags as boundaries -->You can restrict your search any way
you like as long as you can define to DLXS XPAT where the restricted area
starts and where it ends. This is easiest if text components like
chapters or paragraphs are marked in the text, by tags for example. The
poem on the facing page contains tags that mark the start
and end of the title, contents, and author components of a poem. Assume
that this poem is one in a collection of poems marked in the same
manner. By giving instructions to DLXS XPAT to search only within text that
falls between <i>&lt;title></i> and <i>&lt;/title></i> tags,
for example, you can restrict your search to all the poem titles in the
collection.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: content as boundaries -->You don't have to use tags to
define the area to search; you can use any text including the actual
content. Suppose you wanted to restrict your search to an individual
poem. The short poem on the facing page serves as a simplified example.
You can define the content of this poem to be all text that lies between
the phrase <i>O my luve's</i> and the word <i>tune</i>.
Notice that a phrase shorter than <i>O my luve's</i> could not be
used since it would repeat in the text; your start and end points must
be unique in the entire text (not just the selected poem) or you will
define more than one part of text.</p>

<p>Heavily used text components are normally defined at index building
time. These have the advantage of being available in any session. You
can also define components during an individual session; however, these
are lost upon leaving the session.</p>

</pre>
<p>The person who installed DLXS XPAT on your system can tell you
whether any components of text have been pre-defined and, if so, what
they are called. Searching within components of the text can be noticeably
slower than searching the complete text.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: patterns within components -->The electronic version of
this manual has pre-defined components of text that include headings,
paragraphs, and examples. All are enclosed within tags. Every paragraph,
for example, is enclosed within <i>&lt;p></i> and
<i>&lt;/p></i> tags. Assume you want to search for all occurrences
of the pattern <i>lrep</i> within paragraphs (called
<i>p</i>):</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; "lrep" within region p</pre>

<p>This command finds all matches to the pattern <i>lrep</i>
that appear within paragraphs. The <i>region</i> stands for components or parts of
text.</p>

<p>The quotation marks around <tt>lrep</tt> are necessary since you
are searching for a pattern that DLXS XPAT would normally
treat as a command.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: components containing patterns -->In addition to searching
for a pattern within components of text, you can search for the start of
the components that contain the pattern, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region p including "lrep"</pre>

<p>Here, the match point is on the beginning <i>&lt;p></i> tag,
rather than the pattern.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: printing components -->The <tt>pr</tt> command can be
modified to print from the match point to the end of a defined text
component. For example, the following command prints the entire
paragraph that contains the match:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.region.p</pre>

<p>Substituting <tt>save</tt> for <tt>pr</tt> puts
the results in a file rather than displaying them on the screen.</p>

<!-- Chris, another "bad" example -->
<pre>
&gt;&gt; region including "save"

</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: search default component -->The most-used component of
text can be set up as the default component. This means you do not have
to specify the text component you wish to search or print, for
example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region including "{PrintMode}"</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.region</pre>

<p>In this manual, the most-used components are the sections or modules
(text from the beginning of one main heading to the beginning of the
next).</p>

<p>The first example on the facing page searches for modules that
include references to <tt>{Printmode}</tt>. This allows you to see the
heading of the module and to start reading at the beginning of the
module rather than somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: restrict number of matches -->You may want to restrict
your search to those components that contain more than a certain number
of references to a word. For example, if you wanted to search this
manual for information on saving search results, you would expect that
the module with the most information would mention the word
<i>save</i> at least more than once. To get only those modules
that have 2 or more references to <tt>save</tt> within them, the
command would be as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region including.2 "save"</pre>

<p>You can see on the facing page that although three modules contain
the word <i>save</i> only one module contains more than one
reference to the word.</p>

<p>You can define your own components if your text has no pre-defined
ones or if those that exist do not suit your purpose. However, these
are only available for the duration of your DLXS XPAT session.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: specify start and end -->You define a text component by
specifying its starting and ending text. For example, suppose you
wanted to define chapter components for every chapter in a book. Let's
assume that each chapter has the following tags:</p>

<pre>
<tt>&lt;chap>&lt;no>13&lt;/no>&lt;ctitle>FIXING THE NETS&lt;/ctitle>...&lt;/chap></tt>
</pre>

<p>The <i>&lt;chap></i> tag marks the beginning of the chapter and
the <i>&lt;/chap></i> tag marks its end. To create this text
component, the command is as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; chapter = region "&lt;chap>".."&lt;/chap>"</pre>

<p>The name to the left of the equals sign is the name you'll use later
to search this component. The <tt>region</tt> command identifies this
command sequence as a document definition rather than a range search.
The first pattern is the starting text of the component and the second
pattern is the ending text of the component.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: using an asterisk -->Searching your own components differs
slightly from searching pre-defined components. Instead of putting
<tt>region</tt> in front of the component name, the component name is
preceded by an asterisk. For example, to search for occurrences of a
pattern within chapters, the command is:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; "mrs. lyons" within *chapter</pre>

<p>To search for the beginning of chapters that contain references to a
pattern, the command is:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; *chapter including "mrs. lyons"</pre>

<p>A <tt>pr</tt> command after this example search shows that chapters
11 and 13 contain the reference.</p>

the commands would be as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; *ctitle including holmes</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.region.*ctitle</pre>

<p>When printing a component you've defined, you need to include an
asterisk (<i>*</i>) before its name.</p>

<p>Substituting <tt>save</tt> for <tt>pr</tt> puts the results in
a file rather than displaying them on the screen.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: moving end point -->Notice that the titles end at the
first letter of the tag rather than at the end of the closing tag. DLXS XPAT
creates components by starting at the first character of the starting
text (the <i>&lt;</i> in <i>&lt;ctitle></i>) and going to the
<i>first</i> character of the ending text (the <i>&lt;</i> in
<i>&lt;/ctitle></i>). This means that anything after the first
character in the ending text is not included in the definition of the
component.</p>

<p>This can be a problem when you use the content of the text to define a
component. Suppose you have defined a poem by specifying its first and
last phrase as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; poem = region "O my luve's".."played in tune."</pre>

<p>You can not search for the phrase <i>in tune</i> within
<i>*poem</i> because the component ends at the <i>p</i> in
<i>played</i>. To get around the problem, when defining the
component you can use the <tt>shift</tt> command to move the match
point to the end of the phrase:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; poem = region "O my luve's"..(shift.14 "played in tune.")</pre>

<p>This moves the match point 14 characters to the right, to the
period after <i>tune</i>.</p>


 

 
<h2>Searching a Hierarchy of Text Components</h2> 


<!-- index: Tags --><!-- index: to mark components of text -->

<p><!-- keyword: OED as example -->Some documents, such as dictionaries or
encyclopedias, are highly structured. <i>The Oxford English
Dictionary</i> (<i>OED</i>) is a good example of a highly
structured text.  The entry for <i>broom-man</i> from the
electronic version of this text appears on the facing page.</p>

<p>The <i>OED</i> has many tags to label the components of the text.
A few levels of text components have been marked in the excerpt. The
beginning and ending entry tags <i>&lt;E></i> and
<i>&lt;/E></i> surround the whole entry. Within the entry are many
other tags. For example, the tags <i>&lt;ET></i> and
<i>&lt;/ET></i> surround the etymology section of the entry, the
part that describes the origin of the word. The <i>&lt;Q></i> and
<i>&lt;/Q></i> tags surround each supporting quotation. Within the
quotation tags, the <i>&lt;D></i>, <i>&lt;A></i>,
<i>&lt;W></i> and <i>&lt;T></i> series of tags surround the
date, author, work, and text components of the quotation,
respectively.</p>

<p>Components can exist on the same level or be nested within one
another.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; region HL within (region E including (region Q including science))
  4: 2564 matches
</pre>

<p>In a highly structured text like the <i>OED</i>, there
will be times when you'll need to search through a hierarchy of
components for a pattern. An example is a search for a component that
contains a sub-component that contains a pattern. For example, consider
the following problem:</p>

<p><!-- keyword: step-by-step -->You would like to find the names of the
dictionary entries that contain quotations with the pattern
<i>science</i>. You can break this search into three steps.</p>

<ol><li><p>Find quotation components that contain
<i>science</i>.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region Q including science</pre>
</li> 

<li><p>Find the entry components that contain
these quotation components.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region E including %</pre>
</li> 

<li><p>Find the entry name
(headword lemma) within these entries.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region HL within %</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p><i>%</i> stands for the previous results.</p>

<p>You can then use <tt>pr.region.HL</tt> to print only the headword
lemmas.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: combining steps -->An alternative way to do this search is
to type it all on one line, using parentheses to show DLXS XPAT what steps
it should do first:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region HL within (region E including (region Q including
science))</pre>

<p>DLXS XPAT searches within parentheses first. Using this set of results,
DLXS XPAT does the final search, producing the final set of results. With
this alternative, you don't save any intermediate results.</p>



<h1>Manipulating Sets of Results</h1>

<p>When doing more complex searches, you may deal with many sets of
results. To keep track of them, you can give them descriptive names and
refer to them by name rather than by set number. You can also do basic
set operations. You can combine sets (union), find the difference
between sets (difference) and find where sets share results
(intersection).</p>


<h2>Naming Set Results</h2>

&gt;&gt; blcat = 2
  blcat = 26 matches

&gt;&gt; blackcat = *blcat
  blackcat = 26 matches
</pre>
<p><b>Using a Name in a Search</b></p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt; pr.200 sample.1 *bldog
 23379319, ..his luck..The black dog was on his back, as people say, in terrifyi
ng nursery metaphor.&lt;/T&gt;&lt;/Q&gt;&lt;/QP&gt;&lt;/S6&gt;&lt;/S4&gt;&lt;/E&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;HG&gt;&lt;HT&gt;black drop..

</pre>

<p><!-- keyword: use equals sign -->Previous set results are frequently
referred to by their set numbers; however, you can also refer to them by
name. You name a set of results by preceding the search with the name
and an equals sign, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; bldog = "black  " near "dog  "</pre>

<p>The results are assigned
to the name <i>bldog</i>. You can also name a
previous set of results, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; blcat = 2</pre>

<p>The above command assigns the name <i>blcat</i> to the results
of set 2. You can use this name instead of the number 2 when referring
to this set.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: use asterisk -->When you refer to a set by name you must
precede it with an asterisk; otherwise, DLXS XPAT will search for the name
as a pattern rather than as a set of results. The only time you can
specify the name without an asterisk is when you assign a
value to it (when the name appears before the equals sign), for
example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; blackcat=*blcat</pre>

<p>With the above command, there are now three ways to refer to our
example set: by set number, by the name <i>blcat</i> or
<i>blackcat</i>.</p>

<p>A second example of referring to a named set is as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; pr.200 sample.1 *bldog</pre>

<p>The above command prints 200 characters around a single match in the set
identified by <i>*bldog</i>.</p>

<p>Names can contain any letter in the alphabet or any number;
however, they cannot <i>start</i> with a number. You cannot use
special characters such as <i>.</i> or <i>?</i> in your name
unless you enclose the whole name within quotation marks:
<i>"name?"</i>, for example.</p>

<dt>Union</dt><dd>The union of sets refers to the merging

set.</dd>

<dt>Difference</dt><dd>Set difference refers to the
difference between two sets. Matches that appear in the first set that
also appear in the second are eliminated from the final set. In other
words, matches from the first set that do not appear in the second
set form the new set.</dd>

<dt>Intersection</dt><dd>The intersection of sets refers
to the comparison of two sets to find common matches. These common
matches form a new set.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Difference Between Sets</b></p>
<p><b>Intersection of Sets</b></p>

<p>You can further refine your search by combining or
comparing sets. You can compare sets to find the different or common
elements. These operations are the same as the mathematical set
operations: <i>union</i>, <i>difference</i> and
<i>intersection</i>.</p>
<p><!-- keyword: union -->The pictures on this and the
facing page may help you visualize these set operations. The circles
beside represent sets of results. The shaded portion represents the
result of the operation.</p>

<p>The first example combines the contents of two sets into one set. The
matches to the word <i>clue</i> are combined with the matches to
the word <i>evidence</i> producing one set of results.</p>
<p><!-- keyword: difference -->The second example
finds the difference between the first and second sets. The difference
can be defined as any matches in the first set that are not also in the
second. Looking on the facing page, a set containing quotations dated
1591 is compared with a set of quotations attributed to Shakespeare. The
common match point is the <i>&lt;Q></i> tag (stands for the
beginning of a quotation). The two quotations that appear in the first
set but are not in the second make up the final set. These are
quotations dated 1591 that are <i>not</i> attributed to
Shakespeare</p>
<p><!-- keyword: intersection -->The third example
finds the matches common to both sets. For example, the set of
quotations dated 1591 is compared to the set of quotations attributed to
Shakespeare. DLXS XPAT produces a new set containing matches common to both
sets, quotations that are both dated 1591 and are attributed to
Shakespeare. The result is one match.</p>

<p><!-- keyword: the + operator -->Combining several sets of results into
one is advantageous when you are interested in collective results. If
you are interested in the number of occurrences of the word
<i>Mrs.</i> as compared to the word <i>Mr.</i>, you can
search for each individually, and produce two sets of results.  If,
however, you are interested in titles in general, you can use the
<tt>+</tt> operator, for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; title = "mr.  " + "mrs.  "</pre>

<p>This command finds the set of matches for <i>mr.</i> and the
set of matches for <i>mrs.</i> and combines them in one set.</p>

<p>When combining sets, duplications are eliminated. For example, if
you combine the set of matches to <i>mrs.</i> with the set of
matches to <i>mrs. delany</i>, your answer will be the number of
matches to <i>mrs.</i> (since all matches to <i>mrs.
delany</i> already appear in the first set.)</p>

<p>A third example searches for quotations taken from the works of three authors:</p>

command is as follows:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; dictat - "dictator  "</pre>

<p>This next example excludes the number <i>1883</i> from the

<pre>&gt;&gt; ("1880" .. "1884") - "1883"</pre>

<p>A third example searches the <i>OED</i> for all quotations dated
1591 except those attributed to Shakespeare. You can break this search
into three steps:</p>
<ol><li><p>Find quotations dated 1591

<p>The result of any set operation is a set of match points, not a set

points <i>&lt;Q></i>, not the entire <i>Q</i> components.
For this reason, you cannot now search for a pattern within this
set without first searching for the <i>Q</i> components that
contain the match points. Then you can search within
those components, for example:</p>

<p><!-- keyword: the ^ operator -->The <tt>^</tt> operator lets
you determine if two or more sets share any results. In the previous
example, set difference was used to find quotations dated 1591 not
attributed to Shakespeare. These same two sets can be intersected to
find quotations dated 1591 that <i>are</i> attributed to
Shakespeare:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; *quotes1591 ^ *quotesshaks</pre>

<p>This query can also be solved by searching for quotations dated
1591 in the way described previously and then using the command <tt>%
including (region A including shaks)</tt> to pull out those quotations
that also have <i>shaks</i> as the author.</p>

<p>The result of any set operation is a set of match points, not a set
of components. The result of the set intersection above is a set of
match points <i>&lt;Q&gt;</i>, not the entire <i>Q</i>
components. For this reason, you cannot search for a pattern within this
set without first searching for the <i>Q</i> components that
contain the match points. Then you can search within those components,
for example:</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt; region Q including %</pre>
<pre>&gt;&gt; "1 Hen. VI" within %</pre>

<p>Consider another example of intersection. Suppose you are interested
in the word <i>university</i> only if it's followed by a reference
to both <i>oxford</i> and <i>cambridge</i>. The
first step is to look for <i>university</i> followed by
<i>oxford</i>:</p>
