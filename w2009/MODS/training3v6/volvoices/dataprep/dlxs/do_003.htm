first, go to /d1 and mount area2 of store1.
Then check for oddly-named directories, for which you will have to change scripts.

the commands in:
Before_Pickup
  are to clean out the directories where you will be depositing materials, putting
older (already processed) files into the subdirectories where they will be needed.
They will need to be modified to move 0012* files into an SPC subdirectory in each 
area, for preprocessing for inclusion in SPC.  The OAI and preservation copies of
these files will belong to SPC, and should NOT be in VV.
