    The DLC-MODS Workbook provides a series of web pages to help you 
    generate a MODS metadata record that follows the Digital Library 
    Federation Implementation Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records, 
    as described in the DLF Aquifer Guidlines November 2006.  These 
    Guidelines and the specific MODS Profile are documented on the 
    MODS Profile Page of the DLC-MODS Workbook.
