////it is used by page_upper.htm which is in the parent.U frame.

////References in vv_compose_tags.js have to remain as simple document.forms[0]

////to be accessible to both parent.U and parent.D files.


///The alert ("Page Loading in Progress.") is to prevent a user from attempting
///to access any page before page_11_lower.htm is fully loaded.

///When you are in debug mode, you may write messages to yourself and display 
///them on this (pink background) page.
///It is highly recommended that you do not do this with page_10_upper.htm.
