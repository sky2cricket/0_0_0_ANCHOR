This is a list of endpoints


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL
SPARQL allows for a query to consist of triple patterns, conjunctions, disjunctions, and optional patterns.[8]
Implementations for multiple programming languages exist.[9] There exist tools that allow one to connect and semi-automatically construct a SPARQL query for a SPARQL endpoint, for example ViziQuer.[10] In addition, there exist tools that translate SPARQL queries to other query languages, for example to SQL[11] and to XQuery.[12]

http://semanticweb.org/wiki/SPARQL_endpoint
 EndPoint (AKA Port)
   [Definition: An association between a fully-specified
   InterfaceBinding and a network address, specified by a URI [IETF RFC
   2396], that may be used to communicate with an instance of a Web
   Service. An EndPoint indicates a specific location for accessing a
   Web Service using a specific protocol and data format.]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database
In computing, a graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. Most graph databases are NoSQL in nature and store their data in a key-value store or document-oriented database. In general terms, they can be considered to be key-value databases with the additional relationship concept added.

From description:
Compare LDA, LSA, humans
The results indicate that humans outperformed all computer algorithms and had an accuracy rate of 94% at the higher level of abstraction and 76% at the lower level of abstraction. At the high level of abstraction, the accuracy rates were 84% for both LSA and LDA and at the lower level, the accuracy rate were 67% for LSA and 64% for LDA.

WHAT IS MapReduce?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce
A MapReduce program is composed of a Map() procedure (method) that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a Reduce() method that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.

The model is inspired by the map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming,[3] although their purpose in the MapReduce framework is not the same as in their original forms.[4] The key contributions of the MapReduce framework are not the actual map and reduce functions (which, for example, resemble the 1995 Message Passing Interface standard's[5] reduce[6] and scatter[7] operations), but the scalability and fault-tolerance achieved for a variety of applications by optimizing the execution engine. As such, a single-threaded implementation of MapReduce will usually not be faster than a traditional (non-MapReduce) implementation; any gains are usually only seen with multi-threaded implementations.[8] The use of this model is beneficial only when the optimized distributed shuffle operation (which reduces network communication cost) and fault tolerance features of the MapReduce framework come into play. Optimizing the communication cost is essential to a good MapReduce algorithm.


As always, IBM has a great explanation.
https://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/mapreduce/
MapReduce is the heart of Hadoop®. It is this programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. The MapReduce concept is fairly simple to understand for those who are familiar with clustered scale-out data processing solutions.

The term MapReduce actually refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform. The first is the map job, which takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value pairs). The reduce job takes the output from a map as input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples. As the sequence of the name MapReduce implies, the reduce job is always performed after the map job.

The Virtual Query Language for Information Retrieval in the SemanticLIFE Framework
http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-239/paper4.pdf
Abstract.
Creating an innovative mediator environment such as graph-
ical user interfaces, lighter weight languages to help the users in the chal-
lenging task of making unambiguous requests is crucial in semantic web
applications. The query language in the Virtual Query System (VQS) of
the SemanticLIFE framework is designed for this purpose. The proposed
query language namely Virtual Query Language (VQL) is in a further
eÆort of reducing complexity in query making from the user-side, as well
as, simplifying the communication for components of the SemanticLIFE
system with the VQS, and increasing the portability of the system.
