These are vagrant files for making vagrant work on windows10 with Hyper-V instead of using virtualBox.

No guarantees that these will work for you!

My os is windows10 v 18.09.  Clean build (not upgrade).

I have several commandlines that I am using with this.

Powershell 5. as admin.
Ubunutu 18.04.1 in Linux subsystem of windows.
Ubuntu 18.04 in vagrant.

This is just to get the vagrantfiles started.

The real task is to rewrite the claw-playbook=vagrantfile to use hyperv in windows10.
